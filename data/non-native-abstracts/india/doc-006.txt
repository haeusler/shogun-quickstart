Salacia chinensis (S. chinensis) is widely distributed in India and Sri
Lanka. Most of the species of genus Salacia are known to have effects on
blood glucose levels; however, the effects of S. chinensis on glucose levels
are seldom reported.
To evaluate the oral hypoglycemic activity of NR- Salacia (1000 mg extract
of S. chinensis) in healthy adults.
Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study was conducted
in healthy volunteers. Single dose of NR-Salacia (1000 mg extract of Salacia
chinensis) and placebo were administered before carbohydrate-rich diet. A
6-point plasma glucose profile was performed at different time intervals up
to 180 min.
NR-Salacia treatment significantly lowered plasma glucose level at 90 min,
and the percentage reduction in glucose concentration was found to be 13.32
as compared to placebo group. A 33.85% decrease in the plasma glucose
positive incremental area under curve (AUC) (0 to 180 min) was observed in
comparison to placebo. No adverse events were recorded throughout the study
period, except for some mild cases of abdominal discomforts like cramping
and distention, vomiting, and headache in both placebo and
NR-Salacia-treated groups.
The study findings revealed that NR-Salacia lowered the post-prandial plasma
glucose levels after a carbohydrate-rich meal and can be used as an oral
hypoglycemic agent.
