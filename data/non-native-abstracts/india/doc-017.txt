A compact dual-band MIMO/diversity antenna is presented with J-slot suitable
for 2.45/5.80 GHz WLAN applications in handheld devices. The radiating
elements are two planar inverted F antennas (PIFA) constructed by metallic
plates and parasitic elements. The antenna is designed to operate at the
resonant frequency 2.45GHz and 5.8GHz of WLAN bands. The proposed antenna
having excellent Envelope Correlation Coefficient (ECC) is well below 0.01,
which meet the diversity performances of MIMO (multiple-input
multiple-output) antenna. The proposed MIMO antenna is characterized with
S-parameters, surface current distributions, diversity parameters, and
radiation patterns.
