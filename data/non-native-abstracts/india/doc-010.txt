In analogy with Piezoelectric Wafer Active Sensors (PWAS), Lead Zirconate
Titanate (PZT) thin films also seem to be promising for Structural Health
Monitoring (SHM) due to a number of reasons. Firstly, PZT thin films with
well oriented domains show enhanced piezoelectric response. Secondly, PWAS
requires comparatively large voltage leading to a demand for thin PZT films
