In this paper we present a framework for realizing arbitrary instruction set
extensions (IE) that are identified post-silicon. The proposed framework has
two components viz., an IE synthesis methodology and the architecture of a
reconfigurable data-path for realization of the such IEs. The IE synthesis
methodology ensures maximal utilization of resources on the reconfigurable
data-path. In this context we present the techniques used to realize IEs for
applications that demand high throughput or those that must process data
streams. The reconfigurable hardware called HyperCell comprises a
reconfigurable execution fabric. The fabric is a collection of
interconnected compute units. A typical use case of HyperCell is where it
acts as a co-processor with a host and accelerates execution of IEs that are
defined post-silicon. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by
evaluating the performance of some well-known integer kernels that are
realized as IEs on HyperCell. Our methodology for realizing IEs through
HyperCells permits overlapping of potentially all memory transactions with
computations. We show significant improvement in performance for streaming
applications over general purpose processor based solutions, by fully
pipelining the data-path.
