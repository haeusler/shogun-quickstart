Titanium–boron–nitrogen (Ti–B–N) films were deposited by DC reactive
magnetron sputtering using single titanium diboride (TiB2) target in argon,
argon–nitrogen mixtures and pure nitrogen gas. The effects of nitrogen
incorporation on the microstructure and mechanical properties of the
deposited films were investigated. The films were characterized by X-ray
diffraction, atomic force microscope, scanning electron microscope, and
X-ray-photoelectron spectroscopy. Under pure argon the films showed the
formation of TiB2. The films deposited in Ar–N2 mixture showed a transition
from a hexagonal P6/mmm structure of TiB2 to the cubic (Fm3m) one of TiN and
then again to hexagonal P6/mmm structure of TiB2 with decreasing nitrogen
partial pressure. TiN was the major crystalline phase for the films
deposited in pure nitrogen gas. Mechanical properties of the films were
evaluated by nanoindentation. The hardness varied from 45 GPa for pure TiB2
films to 11.15 GPa for Ti–B–N films. The energy of indentation analysis from
the load–depth curves, % elastic recovery (%Er) and plots of H3/E2, where H
is hardness and E is elastic modulus, at different indentation depths has
been used to study the Ti–B–N film deformation process.
