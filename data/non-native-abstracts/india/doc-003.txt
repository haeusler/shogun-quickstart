Fourier analyses of both multiple and single-order reflections in FCC
(Ag-4.5 at.% Ge) alloy films (68 to 238 nm thick) indicated appreciable
coherent domain size and lattice strain effects with slight lattice
contraction and significant compressive long-range residual stress. The
study further reveals large concentrations of growth twin stacking faults
but none that were intrinsic or extrinsic. The films showed a high
dislocation density and a strong preferential texture along (111).
