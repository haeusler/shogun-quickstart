ABSTRACT Quantifying software reliability, such as performance and
dependability, through stochastic behavior models (or labeled transition
systems) is already a common practice in the software analysis community.
However, those models are usually too fine grained to represent an accurate
view of the software system by its stakeholders. Scenarios, on the other
hand, are capable not only to describe the system traces as behavior models
do but also depict very clearly the system components designed to provide
the intended system behavior as well as to outline a high level architecture
view of the system being described. In this paper, we introduce a case study
of a safety critical computer based system that is running in an Indian
Nuclear Power Plant. We define clear component interfaces, from which we
analyze its software reliability.
