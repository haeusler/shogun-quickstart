Lead Zirconate Titanate [Pb(Zr,Ti)O3, PZT] thin films have been extensively
studied due to their possible applications in ferroelectric and
piezoelectric devices. This work deals with the synthesis and
characterization of ultra thin PZT films of thickness ∼100 nm deposited on
Si/SiO2/TiO2/Pt(111) by RF Magnetron Sputtering under optimized deposition
and post-annealing conditions. Various techniques like XRD, XPS, SIMS, SEM
and TEM, have been employed to characterize the film nanostructure and the
interface quality in the post-annealed films. Though the XRD results showed
the formation of ∼87 vol% perovskite phase with 111 orientation, the films
failed to show good electrical and ferroelectric properties. In XPS study of
annealed PZT films, Pb was found to exist in both oxidised and metallic
states. Both SIMS depth profiling and STEM-EDX line profile results showed
that there is an enrichment of Pb along the PZT/Pt interface. This suggests
interdiffusion of the elements in the film during post-annealing. It is
concluded that interdiffusion of the chemical species during annealing
results in Pb enrichment at the film substrate interface. In addition, the
presence of ∼13% non-ferroelectric pyrochlore phase as well as some amount
of Pb species present in metallic state further degrades the film quality.
