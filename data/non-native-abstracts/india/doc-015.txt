In this letter, a low-profile quad-band antenna array for
multiple-inputâ€“multiple-output (MIMO) application has been presented. The
proposed two-antenna array operates at GPS
L1/Bluetooth/Wi-Fi/LTE2500/WiMAX/HIPERLAN1 frequency bands. Each antenna
element has an area of $25times 10 {hbox{mm}}^{2}$ over a small ground plane
of the size $100times 60 {hbox{mm}}^{2}$ . To maintain the small size of the
antenna element, folded patch is used. A rectangular slot is etched on the
main radiator to utilize the higher-order mode. A quarter-wavelength
resonator is integrated at the edge of folded patch to get an additional
resonance for quad-band operation. An antenna prototype is fabricated, and
measured results are in good agreement with simulated results. Radiation
characteristics and diversity performance of the proposed structure are
presented.
