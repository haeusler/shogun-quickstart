We investigate small-world networks from the point of view of their origin.
While the characteristics of small-world networks are now fairly well
understood, there is as yet no work on what drives the emergence of such a
network architecture. In situations such as neural or transportation
networks, where a physical distance between the nodes of the network exists,
we study whether the small-world topology arises as a consequence of a
tradeoff between maximal connectivity and minimal wiring. Using simulated
annealing, we study the properties of a randomly rewired network as the
relative tradeoff between wiring and connectivity is varied. When the
network seeks to minimize wiring, a regular graph results. At the other
extreme, when connectivity is maximized, a "random" network is obtained. In
the intermediate regime, a small-world network is formed. However, unlike
the model of Watts and Strogatz [Nature 393, 440 (1998)], we find an
alternate route to small-world behavior through the formation of hubs, small
clusters where one vertex is connected to a large number of neighbors.
