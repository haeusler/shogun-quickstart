This short paper presents a framework for periodic execution of task-flow
graphs that enables schedulability analysis of the communication
requirements. The analysis performs the steps of segmenting messages,
assigning the segments to specific links and time intervals, and ordering
them within the intervals to generate node switching schedules that provide
contention-free message routing at run-time. The analysis is also used to
integrate task allocation with message routing using a contention-based
objective function. Usefulness of the proposed scheme in ensuring guaranteed
communication performance is demonstrated by an appropriate example.
