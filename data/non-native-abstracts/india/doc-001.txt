This paper describes how the allocation of stream of tasks, with minimum
knowledge, is possible in a distributed computing
system. In literature, almost all the task allocation models in a
distributed computing system require a priori knowledge
of tasks execution time, communication time etc. on the processing nodes.
Since the task assignment is not known in advance,
this time is difficult to estimate. A cluster-based dynamic allocation
scheme is proposed for both the distributed computing
system and the tasks that eliminate the execution time requirement. Further,
as opposed to a single task, multiple tasks are
considered for allocation by the model. For both the task clustering and
processor clustering a fuzzy function is used. Clustering
and assignment process is used dynamically as it suits the stochastic stream
of incoming tasks. Experimental validate the
efficacy of the proposed model.
