The concept of a pairwise loss function arises in learning situations
where the aim is to model pairwise interactions within a domain.
Formulations for learning problems such as metric learning, kernel
learning and bipartite ranking typically utilize such loss functions to
capture the performance of a learned hypothesis.

The use of such loss functions presents unique algorithmic and learning
theoretic challenges. In the past this has encouraged a lot of research in
the use of such loss functions in the batch setting. In this work we
investigate learning with pairwise loss functions in the online setting in
an effort to develop scalable learning formulations. This is joint work
with Bharath Sriperumbudur, U. Cambridge, Prateek Jain, MSR India and
Harish Karnick, IIT Kanpur.
