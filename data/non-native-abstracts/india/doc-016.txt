In this paper, an ultra-wideband (UWB) antenna with dual band-notched
characteristics
is proposed. The proposed antenna also covers ISM (Industrial, Scientific,
and
Medical)/Bluetooth band. The antenna consists of a microstrip fed truncated
U-shaped patch,
T-shaped stub, rectangular mushroom type electromagnetic band gap structures
(EBG), and
partial ground plane. To mitigate the problem of interference due to
standard narrow bands
(like wireless interoperability microwave access (WiMAX) and wireless local
area network
(WLAN)) lie in the range of UWB, dual band notched characteristics is
introduced. The
WiMAX and WLAN band notched characteristics are realized by introducing a
T-shaped
stub and rectangular mushroom type EBG structures, respectively. The
proposed antenna
is printed on a 1.6mm thick FR4 substrate with relative permittivity (εr)
4.4 and the size
of actual antenna is 36 × 40 mm2. The measured results shows that the
proposed antenna
attains a wide impedance bandwidth (VSWR ≤ 2) from 2.35 to 11.6GHz with dual
band
notched characteristics from 3.29 to 3.9GHz and 5.1 to 5.85GHz with stable
radiation patterns. The time domain behaviors of the proposed antenna is also analyzed for pulse
handling
capability.
