Detonation nanodiamond (DND) seeding recently emerged as an effective method
for enhancing nucleation of chemical vapor deposited (CVD) diamond on
non-diamond substrates. This work attempts to provide insight on this
effect. For this purpose, polycrystalline diamond coatings were deposited on
DND-treated silicon substrates. The exposed nucleation surface side was
examined with x-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM); it was found
to contain micron-sized granular features, composed of 25-40 nm diamond
nanocrystals, similar in size to the DND seeds. HRTEM images further confirm
this similarity. A detailed analysis of the nanocarbon phase diagram
suggests that nanodiamond crystals can form under CVD environments.
