Undoped TiO2 and Ag–TiO2 (up to 23 at.% Ag) cermet thin films and
polycrystalline powders have been prepared by sol–gel process. Their
structure, composition, surface morphology and optical properties have been
investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential thermal analysis
(DTA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS), secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and ultraviolet–visible
spectroscopy (UV–VIS spectroscopy). It has been observed that while Ag does
not form a solid solution with TiO2, it promotes the anatase to rutile phase
transformation. The transformation temperature decreases from 827 °C for
undoped TiO2 to about 650 °C for 23 at.% Ag-doped TiO2. SIMS analyses show
that Ag is mostly present on the surface of the films. XPS studies confirm
that these Ag are in the Ag0 state. Optical analyses show that with
increasing Ag content, the refractive index (n) increases and the optical
absorption behavior of the cermet films is modified, but the band gap of the
anatase TiO2 is not influenced.
