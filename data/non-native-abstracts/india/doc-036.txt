Microstructure of the double-layered ceramic thermal barrier coatings of
lanthanum zirconate (LZ) and yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) with bond coat
on Ni-based superalloy deposited by electron beam evaporation process has
been studied. Two sets of combination of LZ and YSZ were deposited: one LZ
over YSZ and the other YSZ over LZ. The interfaces of each layer were
studied and were found to be sharp; however, some diffusion of elements from
below layer was observed. The detailed selected area diffraction of the
phases was carried out from the coating cross-section specimens. The LZ
layer was mostly found to be amorphous, and fine columnar growth was
observed. The YSZ layer over LZ showed two different crystal structures at
interface and at the top surface, which were cubic and tetragonal,
respectively. The YSZ layers showed clear columnar grains with feather-like
intercalated structure
