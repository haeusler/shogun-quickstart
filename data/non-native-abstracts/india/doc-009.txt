This paper presents two innovative techniques developed and implemented for
the automation of the landmine detection in a data scanned by the laser
Doppler vibrometer (LDV) based acoustic to seismic (A/S) landmine detection
system. These techniques are based on the intensity component of the color
landmine images or on grayscale versions of these images. The obtained
results are promising in terms of accuracy, consistency, reliability and
processing time.
