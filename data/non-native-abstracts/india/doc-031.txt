Having long been recognized in combinatorics, the concept of
submodularity is becoming increasingly important in machine learning, since
it can capture intuitive and yet nontrivial interactions between variables.
This expressiveness has found many applications in machine learning,
particularly in understanding structured data like text, vision and speech.
Submodular functions naturally capture aspects of information, coverage
and diversity in maximization problems, while also modeling notions of
cooperation, sparsity, complexity and economies of scale in minimization
problems. In this talk, we shall consider a large class of submodular
optimization problems and motivate them with several real world
applications, particularly in machine learning. We shall then provide a
unifying algorithmic framework for solving several of these optimization
problems, and highlight the scalability and practicality of this approach.
We shall ground this entire talk with a large number of applications in
machine learning, including image segmentation, image correspondence, image
collection summarization, document and news summarization, feature
selection, and training data subset selection. This talk should be self
contained and shall not require prior knowledge of submodular functions and
optimization.
