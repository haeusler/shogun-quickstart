Effect on microstructure, hardness, modulus, fracture toughness and
oxidation behaviour of Al2O3–ZrB2 composite with different percentages of
Titanium as diluents during the SHS reaction has been studied. It was
observed that Ti addition leads to formation of different phases such as
TiB2, ZrO2, TiB besides ZrB2 and Al2O3. The hardness and modulus were found
to be around 21 GPa and 350 GPa, respectively for 10 wt.% Ti addition in
dynamic depth indentation. Oxidation study of the sample having 25 wt.%
Titanium showed no significant change in phase and mechanical properties
after 700 °C oxidation. The toughness of 20 wt.% Ti sample showed highest
fracture toughness.
