Influence of both calcination ambient and film thickness on the optical and
structural properties of sol–gel derived TiO2 thin films have been studied.
X-ray diffraction results show that prepared films are in an anatase form of
TiO2. Films calcined in argon or in low vacuum (∼2×10−1mbar) are found to be
smaller in crystallite size, more transparent at low wavelength region of
∼300–450nm, denser, have higher refractive index and band gap energy
compared to air-calcined films. Scanning electron microscopic study reveals
that surfaces of TiO2 films calcined in argon or in low vacuum are formed by
densely packed nano-sized particulates. Presence of voids and signs of
agglomeration can be seen clearly in the surface microstructure of
air-calcined films. In the thickness range ∼200–300nm, band gap energy and
crystallite size of TiO2 films remain practically unaffected with film
thickness but refractive index of thinner film is found to be marginally
higher than that of thicker film. In this work, it has been shown that apart
from temperature and soaking time, partial pressure of oxygen of the ambient
is also an important parameter by which crystallite size, microstructure and
optical properties of the TiO2 films may be tailored during calcination
period.
