Based on the results of X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and analytical
scanning/transmission electron microscopy (S/TEM), the crystallization trend
and local chemistry of sputtered PZT films on SrTiO3 (STO) coated corning
glass substrates have been scrutinized as functions of STO layer thickness
(∼20–150 nm) and post-annealing temperature (450 C–650 °C). It is shown that
as a seed layer, STO thin films promote perovskite PZT nucleation at the
PZT/STO interface at a temperature of ∼450 °C. Irrespective of STO seed
layer thickness, PZT films evolve as a bi-layered structure comprising of
tetragonal perovskite and disordered fcc fluorite upon post-annealing. The
perovskite crystals are found to be enriched with Pb and lean in Zr and
oxygen than fluorite structures. During the post-crystallization growth, Zr
atoms get preferentially segregated from perovskite structures and
accumulate in top fluorite zone resulting in Zr-enrichment in the latter.
Thinner STO seed layers are observed to be more effective in realizing
better perovskite growth while crystallographic orientation selection of
perovskite is dependent on both seed layer thickness and post-annealing
temperature. Transverse compositional homogeneity of the grown perovskite
PZT and the level of Pb-diffusion from film to the seed layer and glass
substrate are also observed to be seed layer thickness dependent.
