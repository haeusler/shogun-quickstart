An X-ray powder profile analysis in vanadium pentoxide powder milled in a
high energy vibrational ball-mill for different
lengths of time (0–250 h), is presented. The strain and size induced
broadening of the Bragg reflection for two different
crystallographic directions ([001] and [100]) was determined by
Warren-Averbach analysis using a pattern-decomposition method
assuming a Pseudo-Voigt function. The deformation process caused a decrease
in the crystallite size and a saturation of crystallite
size of ∼ 10 nm was reached after severe milling. The initial stages of
milling indicated a propensity of size-broadening
due to fracture of the powder particles caused by repeated ball-to-powder
impact whereas with increasing milling time microstrain
broadening was predominant. WA analysis indicated significant plastic strain
along with spatial confinement of the internal
strain fields in the crystallite interfaces. Significant strain anisotropy
was noticed in the different crystallographic directions.
A near-isotropy in the crystallite size value was noticed for materials
milled for 200 h and beyond. The column-length distribution
function obtained from the size Fourier coefficients progressively narrowed
down with the milling time.
