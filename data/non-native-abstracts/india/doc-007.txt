This paper proposes the most feasible configuration of a stand alone PV/Wind
Hybrid Energy System with diesel generator as a backup for cellular mobile
telephony base station site in isolated areas of Central India. It is
expected that the newly developed and installed system will provide very
good opportunities for mobile telephony base station in near future. The
meteorological data of Solar Insolation, hourly wind speed, are taken for
Bhopal, Central India and the pattern of load consumption of mobile base
station are studied and suitably modeled for pre-feasibility study of the
hybrid energy system. This system is more cost effective and environmental
friendly over the conventional diesel generator. It should reduced
approximate Seventy to Eighty percent fuel cost over conventional diesel
generator and also reduced the emission of Carbon dioxide and other harmful
gasses in environments.
