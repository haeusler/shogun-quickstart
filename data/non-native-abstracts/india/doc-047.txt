In this proposal, we describe a Smart Home Energy Management System (SHEMS)
for effective home power management. This system, after gathering
information about the various home appliances, monitors and controls their
performance for the most efficient power consumption scenario. To aid this
function, we also describe a PLC Power Controlled Outlet Module (PPCOM). A
home server connected to the PPCOM network is proposed as part of a Star
topology. The server is provided with required parameters of all devices on
the home grid by microprocessors of each device, enabling it to reach
decisions about their performance. Elementary tests & surveys indicate that
our design can be implemented practically and does not require any radical
changes in the existing infrastructure.
