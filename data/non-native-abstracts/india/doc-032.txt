In a Spoken Dialog System the Dialog Manager(DM) is the component
responsible for managing the state of the conversation and deciding what
action to take next. Traditional rule-based DM's are unable to handle the
increasing complexity and sophistication of modern conversational systems
like Apple Siri or Samsung S-Voice, and there has been much recent
interest in building data-driven solutions instead. In this talk, I will
give an overview of the current state of the art in machine learning
methods applied to Dialog Management particularly on the problems of
Belief Tracking (monitoring the state of the dialog and the intent of the
user) and Action Selection (deciding what to say next). I will describe a
graphical model approach for Belief Tracking called a Probabilistic 
Ontology Tree and present results of the recently concluded First Dialog 
State Tracking Challenge. I will also survey recent Reinforcement Learning 
approaches to Action Selection.
