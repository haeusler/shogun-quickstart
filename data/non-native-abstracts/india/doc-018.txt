Aerial telecommunications have been investigated for three decades through
the design and evaluation of stratospheric platforms able to offer multiple
types of wireless services. HAP may be airplanes or airships and may be
manned or unmanned with autonomous operation coupled with remote control
from the ground. There is increasing interest in the development of airspace
platforms in recent years, for example, HAP carrying equipment for
telecommunications, remote sensing or digital broadcasting. The multiple
types of platform are able to carry a communication payload at different
altitudes. Regarding the altitude of aerial communication, there are three
categories of balloons, High Altitude Platforms (HAP), Medium Altitude
platform (MAP) and Low Altitude Platform (LAP). HAPs provide an excellent
option for emergency communications, their survivability during a disaster
and ability to be continuously on station offer an ideal solution for an
emergency communications capability. This paper focused on the basic
characteristics of communication systems based on HAP, it outlines
alternative network architecture scenarios for provision of wireless access
to broadband communication services. HAP can coexist with WiMAX in same
coverage area. Therefore, these systems can work efficiently and effectively
with share frequency to sustain high QoS.
