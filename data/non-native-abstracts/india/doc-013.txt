Two-dimensional (2-D) analytical modeling for a novel multiple region MOSFET
device architecture-Tri-Material Gate Stack MOSFET-is presented, which shows
reduced short-channel effects at short gate lengths. Using a three-region
analysis in the horizontal direction and a universal depletion width
boundary condition, the 2-D potential and electric field distribution in the
channel region along with the threshold voltage of the device are obtained.
The proposed model is capable of modeling electrical characteristics like
surface potential, electric field, and threshold voltage of various other
existent MOSFET structures like dual-material-gate, electrically induced
shallow junction/straddle-gate (side-gate), and single-material-gate
MOSFETs, with and without the gate stack architecture. The 2-D device
simulator ATLAS is used over a wide range of parameters and bias conditions
to validate the analytical results
