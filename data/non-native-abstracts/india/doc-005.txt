ABSTRACT Interactive cooperation of local best and global best solution
encourages particles to move towards them, with a hope that better solution
may present in the neighboring positions around local best or global best.
However, this encouragement does not guarantees that movements taken by
particle will always be the suitable one (comparatively better solution).
With the influence of three random parameters in PSO-RANDIW increases
exploration power as well as probability of unsuitable movements (move
towards comparatively worst solution). These unsuitable movement may delay
in convergence. In this paper, we have introduced a noble method to avoid
such move with cognition of particle's own worst solution. Analysis on well
known four benchmark functions shows proposed approach performance is
comparatively better.
