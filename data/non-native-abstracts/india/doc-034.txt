Rietveld’s whole powder profile fitting method based on crystal structure
refinement is applied to extract the microstructure information of several
polymorphic TiO2 phases grown simultaneously during high energy vibratory
ball milling of anatase phase. Warren–Averbach’s method of X-ray line
profile analysis is also made for comparison of above results. The X-ray
powder patterns of four TiO2 phases along with α-Al2O3 (contamination) are
simulated simultaneously for the first time to fit the experimental X-ray
powder patterns of multiphase materials. The structural details of
monoclinic TiO2 (B) phase are also reported first time in this paper. The
advantages of the present method of analysis over the other methods of X-ray
line profile analysis are discussed in details.
