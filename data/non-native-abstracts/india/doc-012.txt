 In this paper, a strong inversion drain current model incorporating various
effects such as channel length modulation has been developed for a
short-channel symmetrical triple material - double gate (TM-DG) MOSFET based
on the drift current equation. The model results have been compared with the
simulation data obtained by using the commercially available device
simulation software ATLASâ„¢.
