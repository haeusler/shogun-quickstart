The porous core layer deposited by modified chemical vapour deposition
process has been analyzed in terms of thickness, pore size distribution,
homogeneity and characteristics of the soot particles to investigate their
variation with deposition temperature and input vapour composition. The
compositions selected were SiO(2), SiO(2)-GeO(2) and SiO(2)-P(2)O(5). Rare
earth ions were incorporated into the deposit by a solution doping
technique. The analysis of deposited microstructures was found to provide a
quantitative indication about the rare earth incorporation and its variation
with respect to process conditions. Thus the characterization provides a
method of controlling rare earth doping and ultimate preform/fiber
properties.
