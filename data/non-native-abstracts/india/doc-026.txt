In recent times, there has been an exponential rise in the number of protein
structures in databases e.g. PDB. So, design of fast algorithms capable of
querying such databases is becoming an increasingly important research
issue. This paper reports an algorithm, motivated from spectral graph
matching techniques, for retrieving protein structures similar to a query
structure from a large protein structure database. Each protein structure is
specified by the 3D coordinates of residues of the protein. The algorithm is
based on a novel characterization of the residues, called projections,
leading to a similarity measure between the residues of the two proteins.
This measure is exploited to efficiently compute the optimal equivalences.
RESULTS: Experimental results show that, the current algorithm outperforms
the state of the art on benchmark datasets in terms of speed without losing
accuracy. Search results on SCOP 95% nonredundant database, for fold
similarity with 5 proteins from different SCOP classes show that the current
method performs competitively with the standard algorithm CE. The algorithm
is also capable of detecting non-topological similarities between two
proteins which is not possible with most of the state of the art tools like
Dali.
