In this paper, a threshold voltage model of short-channel
recessed-source/drain (Re-S/D) ultra-thin body (UTB) SOI MOSFETs has been
presented considering the substrate induced surface potential (SISP) to
improve the model accuracy over wide ranges of device parameters and
substrate bias. The potential distribution of the front and the back
surfaces of the Si-body have been derived using the evanescent mode analysis
method in which the channel potential is broken into one-dimensional
long-channel potential and two-dimensional short-channel potential. A
one-dimensional Poisson's equation has also been solved in the substrate
region to account the effect of substrate induced surface potential (SISP)
at substrate/buried-oxide interface. The minimum front- and back-surface
potentials of silicon body have been used to obtain front and back channel
threshold voltages, respectively. However, the smaller one between front and
back channel threshold voltages is considered to be the threshold voltage of
the device. The accuracy of the present model has been extended up to 10 nm
channel length by incorporating the quantum effects induced correction term.
The model results are verified with simulation results obtained using ATLASâ„¢
from Silvaco.
