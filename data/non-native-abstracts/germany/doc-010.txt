Service discovery is a fundamental concept in service networks. It provides
networks with the capability to publish, browse and locate service
instances. Service discovery is thus the precondition for a service network
to operate correctly and for the services to be available. In the last
decade, decentralized service discovery mechanisms have become increasingly
popular. Especially in ad-hoc scenarios - such as ad-hoc wireless networks -
they are an integral part of auto-configuring service networks. Albeit the
fact that auto-configuring networks are increasingly used in application
domains where dependability is a major issue, these environments are
inherently unreliable. In this paper, we examine the dependability of
decentralized service discovery. We simulate service networks that are
automatically configured by Zeroconf technologies. Since discovery is a
time-critical operation, we evaluate responsiveness - the probability to
perform some action on time even in the presence of faults - of domain name
system (DNS) based service discovery under influence of packet loss. We show
that responsiveness decreases significantly already with moderate packet
loss and becomes practicably unacceptable with higher packet loss.
