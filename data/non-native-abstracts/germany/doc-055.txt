Forty Polish children aged between 1;8 and 2;3 were trained over two
training sessions in the comprehension of the preposition POD [UNDER]. In
the experiment, two variables were manipulated: a within subjects variable
of SITUATION and a between subjects variable of LINGUISTIC INPUT. The effect
of situation could be found in all trained groups, showing that children's
understanding in familiar and transfer situations differed significantly
from the performance of the control group in the post-test. The results
further suggest that depending on the type of a situation, the linguistic
task requires different word learning abilities from a child.
