The recognition of object categories in 3D scenes is still a challenging
problem in computer vision. Many state of the art approaches use Implicit
Shape Models, as addressed in [8] and [14], to learn shapes of object
categories and a probabilistic Hough Space Voting for the detection of
instances of the learned category. In this paper we present a novel 3D Hough
Space Voting approach for recognizing object categories, learned from
artificial 3D models, in 3D scenes. The proposed method uses rays instead of
points to vote for object reference points. The usage of ray voting allows a
clustering of votes, showing in similar directions, to a single vote with an
appropriate vote weight. The main advantage for the Implicit Shape Model is
that it can be trained with an unlimited amount of training data, while
keeping the upper bound of computation effort constant. In addition, it is
also able to abstract from the model sizes which is very helpful when
training with artificial models taken from different sources and modelled in
different scales. We validate our approach in two tasks: an object
categorization is performed on a standard 3D dataset of artificial models
and a recognition of furniture categories is evaluated on a dataset of
captured indoor room scenes.
