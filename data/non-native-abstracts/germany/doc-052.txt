Since manual labelling of huge data sets is costly and time-consuming, we
pro-pose a framework for iterative confidence-based self-learning of
classifiers which autonomously extends its knowledge gained based on a small
amount of initial, man-ually labelled training samples towards increasingly
different representatives of the regarded pattern classes. During each
iteration, the labels of newly selected samples are determined and the
samples are added to the training set, subsequently. The cru-cial step is
the selection of the samples which are used for re-training the classifier
during each iteration. For this purpose, we rely as a new approach on the
concept of confidence bands known from the field of statistics.
