In a Nature paper of 2010, the concern was raised that intra-individual
mtDNA variation may be more pronounced than previously believed, in that
heteroplasmies are common and vary markedly from tissue to tissue. This
claim taken at face value would have considerable impact on forensic
casework. It turns out however that the employed technology detected the
germ-line variation relative to the reference sequence only incompletely: on
average at least five mutations were missed per sample, as an in silico
reassessment of the data reveals. Before one can really set out to access to
entire mtDNA genome data with relative ease for forensic purposes, one needs
careful calibration studies under strict forensic conditions-or might have
to wait for another generation.
