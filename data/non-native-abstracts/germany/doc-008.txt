The performance of a soccer robot is highly dependent on its motion ability.
The kicking motion is one of the most important motions in a soccer game.
However, automatic, full body motion generation for humanoid robots presents
a formidable computational challenge. At the current state the most common
approaches of implementing this motion are based on key frame technique.
Such solutions are inflexible, i.e., in order to adjust the aimed direction
of the kick the robot has to walk around the ball. The adjustment costs a
lot of time especially if some precise adjustments have to be done, e.g.,
for a penalty kick. In this paper we present an approach for adaptive
control of the motions. We implemented our approach in order to solve the
task of kicking the ball on a humanoid robot Nao. The approach was tested
both in simulation and on a real robot.
