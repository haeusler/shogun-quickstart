As mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) become ever more popular, it also becomes
more and more interesting to build distributed network applications (e.g.
data storage, etc.) that have been successfully built using DHTs on the
Internet in such MANETs. For this purpose, DHT substrates especially
designed for the use in MANETs have been recently proposed. In this paper,
we demonstrate that such a DHT substrate (MADPastry) can be efficiently used
to not only provide indirect, key-based overlay routing, but also
conventional direct unicasting. Our simulation results show that DHT-based
unicasting can markedly outperform conventional reactive ad hoc routing
(AODV) as well as proactive ad hoc routing (OLSR). Therefore, MANET nodes
that are already running a DHT substrate for application purposes will no
longer have to maintain a separate ad hoc routing protocol in parallel but
can use their DHT substrate for conventional point-to-point ad hoc routing
as well.
