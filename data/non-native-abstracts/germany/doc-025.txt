While executing business processes, a variety of events is produced that is
valuable for getting insights about the process execution. Specifically,
these events can be processed by Complex Event Processing (CEP) engines to
deliver a base for business process monitoring. Mobile, flexible, and
distributed business processes challenge existing process monitoring
techniques, especially if process execution is partially done manually.
Thus, it is not trivial to decide where the required business process
execution information can be found, how this information can be extracted,
and to which point in the process it belongs to. Tackling these challenges,
we present a model-driven approach to support the automated creation of
(CEP) queries for process monitoring. For this purpose, we decompose a
process model that includes monitoring information into its structural
components. Those are transformed to (CEP) queries to monitor business
process execution based on events. For illustration, we show an
implementation for BPMN and describe possible applications.
