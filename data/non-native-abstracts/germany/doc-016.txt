Within the Flaviviridae, the recently designated genus Pegivirus has
expanded greatly due to new discoveries in bats, horses, and rodents. Here
we report the discovery and characterization of three simian pegiviruses
(SPgV) that resemble human pegivirus (HPgV) and infect red colobus monkeys
(Procolobus tephrosceles), red-tailed guenons (Cercopithecus ascanius) and
an olive baboon (Papio anubis). We have designated these viruses SPgVkrc,
SPgVkrtg and SPgVkbab, reflecting their host species' common names, which
include reference to their location of origin in Kibale National Park,
Uganda. SPgVkrc and SPgVkrtg were detected in 47% (28/60) of red colobus and
42% (5/12) red-tailed guenons, respectively, while SPgVkbab infection was
observed in 1 of 23 olive baboons tested. Infections were not associated
with any apparent disease, despite the generally high viral loads observed
for each variant. These viruses were monophyletic and equally divergent from
HPgV and pegiviruses previously identified in chimpanzees (SPgVcpz).
Overall, the high degree of conservation of genetic features among the novel
SPgVs, HPgV and SPgVcpz suggests conservation of function among these
closely related viruses. Our study describes the first primate pegiviruses
detected in Old World monkeys, expanding the known genetic diversity and
host range of pegiviruses and providing insight into the natural history of
this genus.
