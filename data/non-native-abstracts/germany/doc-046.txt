Applications deployed in mobile peer-to-peer systems have to cope with
mobility and fluctuation of nodes. These dynamics restrict the reliability
of communication links as well as the availability of certain nodes,
services, and resources. Exploring the context of nodes can be used to
anticipate these shortages. Context-awareness enables improvement of
performance of systems and enables adaptation of applications in order to
make their behavior more relevant with respect to their current situation.
Preevaluation of context can be used to estimate future availability of
crucial resources and reliability of communication links. Which information
is considered to be relevant context information varies according to the
application scenario. In this paper, we present a model for context
information along with a mobile service that provides a local view of
surrounding nodes in a Mobile Ad-hoc NETwork (MANET). The service is
designed to enable efficient prediction of future stability of the vicinity
of a node.
