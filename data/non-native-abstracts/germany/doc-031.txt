For blind persons, information is often presented through substitute media.
We explore the possibility of emulating visual perception through haptic
perception completely using a new haptic display and using games as a
paradigm. We decsribe an implementation of Sudoku which utilizes the
capabilities of the display: representing the full Sudoku square in its
natural form; entering numbers and notes in the boxes of the square;
emulating visual scanning for information through scanning by touch;
interacting by finger movement (gestures). The only non-haptic component
consists of sounds played to signal the outcome of actions. This
demonstrates the advantages of the planar touch-sensitive refreshable haptic
display when compared with other interaction modes for blind persons.
