Patients want to be more involved in medical decision-making. To this end,
some decision aids are now available.
We present an overview of this subject, in which we explain the terms
"shared decision-making", "decision aid", and "evidence-based patient
information" and survey information on the available decision aids in German
and other languages on the basis of a literature search in MEDLINE, EMBASE
and PsycInfo and a current Cochrane Review. We also searched the Internet
for providers of decision aids in Germany.
Decision aids exist in the form of brochures, decision tables, videos, and
computer programs; they address various topics in the prevention, diagnosis,
and treatment of disease. They typically contain information on the
advantages and disadvantages of the available options, as well as guidance
for personal decision-making. They can be used alone or as a part of
structured counseling or patient education. Minimal quality standards
include an adequate evidence base, completeness, absence of bias, and
intelligibility. Our search revealed 12 randomized controlled trials (RCTs)
of decision aids in German and 106 RCTs of decision aids in other languages.
These trials studied the outcome of the use of decision aids not just with
respect to clinical developments, but also with respect to patient
knowledge, adherence to treatment regimens, satisfaction, involvement in
decision-making, autonomy preference, and decisional conflicts.
Only a small fraction of the available decision aids were systematically
developed and have been subjected to systematic evaluation. Patients are
still not receiving the help in decision-making to which medical ethics
entitles them. Structures need to be put in place for the sustainable
development, evaluation and implementation of high-quality decision aids.
