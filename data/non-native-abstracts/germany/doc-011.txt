The goal of our research is to improve data availability in large-scale
wireless networks in a disaster scenario, where spatially correlated group
of nodes may fail. In this paper, we analytically evaluate the efficacy of
existing replication schemes from structured overlay networks under relaxed
system constraints. The analysis shows that these schemes do not guarantee
data survivability under the assumption of massive node crashes.
