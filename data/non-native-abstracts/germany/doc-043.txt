Name services for mobile ad hoc networks are essential to discover and bind
resources given by their name or URI to a specific network address. As there
is no fixed infrastructure available in MANETs, nodes cannot rely on any
DNS-like system as is taken for granted in the Internet. To keep up with the
dynamicity of MANETs, a name service needs to be flexible and scalable. For
this purpose, we propose MAPNaS (mobile ad-hoc peer-to-peer name service), a
lightweight and locality-aware peer-to-peer based name service. MAPNaS runs
on top of MADPastry (T. Zhan and J. Schiller, June 2005), a general-purpose
DHT substrate especially designed for MANETs. Through simulation we compare
the performance of MAPNaS - both in terms of the success rate and overall
network traffic - against an unstructured, broadcast-based reference
approach. We thereby demonstrate how to efficiently build a peer-to-peer
based name service in mobile ad hoc networks
