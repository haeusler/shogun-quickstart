More and more companies are going to use Internet for their job procurement
process, i.e. to search for job seekers and publish open positions. However,
common search techniques based on classical key-word search fail to match
job seekers with job offers since particular (over-constraint) queries
return no answers and search engines are un-able to semantically relax such
queries. In this paper we briefly describe an approach where explicitly
defined rewriting rules are used to refor-mulate the query in a controlled
way and explain the architecture of our job portal extension giving an
impression about the relaxation process.
