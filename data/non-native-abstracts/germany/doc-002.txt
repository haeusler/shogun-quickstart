Electrophysiological signals such as the EEG, MEG, or LFPs have been
extensively studied over the last decades, and elaborate signal processing
algorithms have been developed for their analysis. Many of these methods are
based on time-frequency decomposition to account for the signals' spectral
properties while maintaining their temporal dynamics. However, the data
typically exhibit intra- and interindividual variability. Existing
algorithms often do not take into account this variability, for instance by
using fixed frequency bands. This shortcoming has inspired us to develop a
new robust and flexible method for time-frequency analysis and signal
feature extraction using the novel smooth natural Gaussian extension (snaGe)
model. The model is nonlinear, and its parameters are interpretable. We
propose an algorithm to derive initial parameters based on dynamic
programming for nonlinear fitting and describe an iterative refinement
scheme to robustly fit high-order models. We further present distance
functions to be able to compare different instances of our model. The
method's functionality and robustness are demonstrated using simulated as
well as real data. The snaGe model is a general tool allowing for a wide
range of applications in biomedical data analysis.
