This paper proposes a quadrilateral finite element method of the lowest
order for Reissner–Mindlin (R–M) plates on the basis of Hellinger–Reissner
variational principle, which includes variables of displacements, shear
stresses and bending moments. This method uses continuous piecewise
isoparametric bilinear interpolation for the approximation of transverse
displacement and rotation. The piecewise-independent shear stress/bending
moment approximation is constructed by following a self-equilibrium
criterion and a shear-stress-enhanced condition. A priori and reliable a
posteriori error estimates are derived and shown to be uniform with respect
to the plate thickness t. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical
results.
