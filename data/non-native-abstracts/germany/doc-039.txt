We study a microscopic follow-the-leader model on a circle of length L with
a bottleneck. Allowing large bottleneck strengths we encounter very
interesting traffic dynamics. Different types of waves--travelling and
standing waves and combinations of both wave types--are observed. The way to
find these phenomena requires a good understanding of the complex dynamics
of the underlying (nonlinear) equations. Some of the phenomena, like the
ponies-on-a-merry-go-round solutions, are mathematically well known from
completely different applications. Mathematically speaking we use Poincar√©
maps, bifurcation analysis and continuation methods beside numerical
simulations.
