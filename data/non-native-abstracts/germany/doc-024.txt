Nowadays, business process modeling and system-supported executions have
become a commodity in many companies. Most systems, however, focus on
modeling and execution of static, pre-defined processes with standards like
the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN). While these static process
executions are applicable to a number of traditional processes like purchase
orderings or back orderings, they fail at representing variant-rich,
flexible processes. One solution for supporting flexible processes is
Adaptive Case Management (ACM), where a case manager is creating an
individual execution path for each process instance, such as a doctor
defining a clinical pathway for a specific patient. We found out, however,
that both approaches are too strict either supporting static process
definitions with only a limited set of pre-defined flexibility or allowing
maximum flexibility but requiring a highly skilled knowledge worker. To
overcome this problem, we propose an implementation framework for Production
Case Management (PCM) that combines concepts from traditional process
management and adaptive case management. PCM combines the modeling of small,
static process fragments with the execution flexibility of ACM.
