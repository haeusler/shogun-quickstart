Governments are increasingly publishing their data to enable organizations
and citizens to browse and analyze the data. However, the heterogeneity of
this Open Government Data hinders meaningful search, analysis, and
integration and thus limits the desired transparency. In this article, we
present the newly developed data integration operators of the Stratosphere
parallel data analysis framework to overcome the heterogeneity. With
declaratively specified queries, we demonstrate the integration of
well-known government data sources and other large open data sets at
technical, structural, and semantic levels. Furthermore, we publish the
integrated data on the Web in a form that enables users to discover
relationships between persons, government agencies, funds, and companies.
The evaluation shows that linking person entities of different data sets
results in a good precision of 98.3% and a recall of 95.2%. Moreover, the
integration of large data sets scales well on up to eight machines.
