We present a Model Driven Development (MDD) approach to the development of
access control policies for distributed systems. The models are expressed as
Meta-Object Facility (MOF) models enriched by Unified Modeling Language
(UML) profiles. The view-based access control model is used as an example,
for which we present a platform independent meta-model and platform specific
meta-models for the Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EE). A management
application is used to build instance models for the platform independent
and platform specific meta-models, respectively.We present in this paper how
the platform independent models can be used to generate the platform
specific models, and how the meta-models can be used to generate the models
for the specific application. Finally, the platform specific models are used
to generate the security policy to be deployed in the security
infrastructure.We show how consistence requirements can be verified formally
by using category-based graph transformations.
