In this paper, we present a framework that allows us to orchestrate web
services such that the web services involved in this orchestration interact
properly. To achieve this, we predefine service interfaces and certain
routing constructs. Furthermore, we define a number of rules to
incrementally compute the price of such a properly interacting orchestration
(i.e. a web service) from the price of its web services. The fact that a web
service gets only payed after its service is delivered (no-cure-no-pay) is
reflected by considering a probability of success. To determine a safe price
that includes the risk a web service takes, we consider the variance of
costs.
