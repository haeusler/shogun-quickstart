With the increasing uptake of business process management efforts in
companies, similarity search in large process model repositories has gained
significance, as it forms a cornerstone of effective process model
management and reuse. Similarity search uses a process model as query and
retrieves all models, which resemble the query, in a ranked order. So far,
the quality of the ranking has not been investigated. In this paper, we
propose quality measures for similarity search results in order to address
this problem, providing information on how good and how differentiated the
results are. Our measures assess result statistics, which are derived from
the similarity to the query model, and the agreement of different rankings,
produced by diverse similarity measures. We apply our findings to a
reference process model collection and comprehensively evaluate their
prediction towards human assessment of process similarity.
