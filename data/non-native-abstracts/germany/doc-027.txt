 We present Stratosphere, an open-source software stack for parallel data
analysis. Stratosphere brings together a unique set of features that allow
the expressive, easy, and efficient programming of analytical applications
at very large scale. Stratosphere’s features include “in situ” data
processing, a declarative query language, treatment of user-defined
functions as first-class citizens, automatic program parallelization and
optimization, support for iterative programs, and a scalable and efficient
execution engine. Stratosphere covers a variety of “Big Data” use cases,
such as data warehousing, information extraction and integration, data
cleansing, graph analysis, and statistical analysis applications. In this
paper, we present the overall system architecture design decisions,
introduce Stratosphere through example queries, and then dive into the
internal workings of the system’s components that relate to extensibility,
programming model, optimization, and query execution. We experimentally
compare Stratosphere against popular open-source alternatives, and we
conclude with a research outlook for the next years.
