We present a model calculation for the temperature dependent behaviour of
surface states on a ferromagnetic local-moment film. The film is described
within the s-f model featuring local magnetic moments being exchange coupled
to the itinerant conduction electrons. The surface states are generated by
modifying the hopping in the vicinity of the surface of the film. In the
calculation for the temperature dependent behaviour of the surface states we
are able to reproduce both Stoner-like and spin-mixing behaviour in
agreement with recent (inverse) photoemission data on the temperature
dependent behaviour of a Gd(0001) surface state.
