We refine a result concerning singular matrix pencils and the Wong
sequences. In our
recent paper [T. Berger and S. Trenn, SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl., 33 (2012),
pp. 336–368] we have
shown that the Wong sequences are sufficient to obtain a quasi-Kronecker
form. However, we applied
the Wong sequences again on the regular part to decouple the regular matrix
pencil corresponding to
the finite and infinite eigenvalues. The current paper is an addition to [T.
Berger and S. Trenn, SIAM
J. Matrix Anal. Appl., 33 (2012), pp. 336–368], which shows that the
decoupling of the regular part
can be done already with the help of the Wong sequences of the original
matrix pencil. Furthermore,
we show that the complete Kronecker canonical form can be obtained with the
help of the Wong
sequences.
