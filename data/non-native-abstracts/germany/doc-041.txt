Thus far, developers have created only partial solutions for using
computational equipment in education. Research must focus more effort on
developing architectures capable of combining technologies that target the
classroom and that allow specifying "what" rather than "how" tasks should be
done. The difficult task of architecting multimedia environments for
teaching must start with a needs analysis. The most challenging task
involves warranting reliability on the one hand, while accommodating
opportunities for innovation on the other. Thus, we propose building a
reliable, ubiquitous, adaptable, and easy-to-use technology-integrating
black box. Placing this system atop a service-oriented component model
implemented on a platform-independent layer such as a virtual machine
provide the adaptability developers need. Loosely coupled components
accommodate a nonmonolithic approach and ease reuse. By reusing and
enhancing components, the system become increasingly reliable, while a
building-block architecture keep it manageable.
