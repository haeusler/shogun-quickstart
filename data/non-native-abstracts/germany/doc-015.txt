Simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV) is an arterivirus that causes severe
disease in captive macaques. We describe two new SHFV variants subclinically
infecting wild African red-tailed guenons (Cercopithecus ascanius). Both
variants are highly divergent from the prototype virus and variants
infecting sympatric red colobus (Procolobus rufomitratus). All known SHFV
variants are monophyletic and share three open reading frames not present in
other arteriviruses. Our data suggest a need to modify the current
arterivirus classification.
