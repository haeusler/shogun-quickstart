We propose a new test for independence of error and covariate in a
nonparametric regression model. The test statistic is based on a kernel
estimator for the L2-distance between the conditional distribution and the
unconditional distribution of the covariates. In contrast to tests so far
available in literature, the test can be applied in the important case of
multivariate covariates. It can also be adjusted for models with
heteroscedastic variance. Asymptotic normality of the test statistic is
shown. Simulation results and a real data example are presented.
