We study the class of linear differential-algebraic m-input m-output systems
which have a transfer function with proper inverse. A sufficient condition
for the transfer function to have proper inverse is that the system has
‘strict and non-positive relative degree’. We present two main results:
first, a so-called ‘zero dynamics form’ is derived; this form is—within the
class of system equivalence—a simple form of the DAE; it is a counterpart to
the well-known Byrnes–Isidori form for ODE systems with strictly proper
transfer function. The ‘zero dynamics form’ is exploited to characterize
structural properties such as asymptotically stable zero dynamics, minimum
phase, and high-gain stabilizability. The zero dynamics are characterized by
(A, E, B)-invariant subspaces. Secondly, it is shown that the ‘funnel
controller’ (that is a static non-linear output error feedback) achieves,
for all DAE systems with asymptotically stable zero dynamics and transfer
function with proper inverse, tracking of a reference signal by the output
signal within a pre-specified funnel. This funnel determines the transient
behaviour.
