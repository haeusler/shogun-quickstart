This paper addresses a typical humanoid problem, that of walking gaits.
Creating a stable walking gait on a humanoid robot is a problem that is
addressed by many roboticists worldwide. We want to focus on a similar issue
that is often overlooked: recognition of different walking behaviours in
humans and humanoid robots. We introduce a method that is able to recognise
persons as well as their current walking behaviour based on accelerometer
data. This is an important skill and prerequisite for all human-humanoid
imitation and interaction tasks.
