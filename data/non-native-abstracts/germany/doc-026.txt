During business process execution, various systems and services produce a
variety of data, messages, and events that are valuable for gaining insights
about business processes, e.g., to ensure a business process is executed as
expected. However, these data, messages, and events usually originate from
different kinds of sources, each specified by different kinds of
description. This variety makes it difficult to automate the detection of
relevant event sources for business process monitoring. In this paper, we
present a course of actions to automatically associate different event
sources to event object types required for business process monitoring. In
particular, in a three-step approach we determine the similarity of event
sources to event object types, rank those results, and derive a mapping
between their attributes. Thus, relevant event sources and their bindings to
specified event object types of business processes can be identified. The
approach is implemented and evaluated using schema matching techniques for
an use case that is aligned with real-world energy processes, data,
messages, and events.
