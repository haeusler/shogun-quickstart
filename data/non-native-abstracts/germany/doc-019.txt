Differential algebraic equations (DAEs) are often automatically generated,
in particular, by coupling different tools. These DAEs are unstructured in
the sense that they do not reveal their mathematical structure a priori. In
view of a reliable treatment of those DAEs, their mathematical structure
should be uncovered and monitored also by computational methods. We discuss
several computational aspects of the tractability index concept.
