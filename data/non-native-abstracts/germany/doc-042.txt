While traditional fixed-wired network protocols like 2-phase-commit
guarantee atomicity, we cannot use them in mobile low bandwidth networks
where network partitioning, node failure, and message loss may result in
blocking. To deploy traditional database applications easily into a mobile
environment, there is a demand for a protocol which guarantees an atomic
commit of transactions. This paper introduces a protocol which can guarantee
such atomic commitment in mobile environments using a combination of commit
and consensus protocols. In addition, it takes advantage of mobile network
sub-structures like single-hop environments to reduce message transfer
costs.
