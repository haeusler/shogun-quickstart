Research results are primarily published in scientific literature and
curation efforts cannot keep up with the rapid growth of published
literature. The plethora of knowledge remains hidden in large text
repositories like MEDLINE. Consequently, life scientists have to spend a
great amount of time searching for specific information. The enormous
ambiguity among most names of biomedical objects such as genes, chemicals
and diseases often produces too large and unspecific search results. We
present GeneView, a semantic search engine for biomedical knowledge.
GeneView is built upon a comprehensively annotated version of PubMed
abstracts and openly available PubMed Central full texts. This
semi-structured representation of biomedical texts enables a number of
features extending classical search engines. For instance, users may search
for entities using unique database identifiers or they may rank documents by
the number of specific mentions they contain. Annotation is performed by a
multitude of state-of-the-art text-mining tools for recognizing mentions
from 10 entity classes and for identifying protein-protein interactions.
GeneView currently contains annotations for >194 million entities from 10
classes for âˆ¼21 million citations with 271,000 full text bodies. GeneView
can be searched at http://bc3.informatik.hu-berlin.de/.
