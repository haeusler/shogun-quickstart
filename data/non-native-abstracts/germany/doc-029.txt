 This paper focuses on the real-world use of cloud-based analytics for
supporting medication track-and-trace and monitoring safety and quality in
the pharmaceutical supply chain. The paper describes a track-and-trace
system developed by German start-up XQS-Service GmbH and adopted by
manufacturers, wholesalers, pharmacies and clinics in Germany. The paper
also discusses the benefits of using in-memory computing to process large
amounts of big data to support efficient and effective medication
track-and-trace.
