This paper describes a home energy management system (HEMS) based on power
line communication. Smart metering and power line communication can provide
detailed information of energy consumption patterns and intelligent
controlling to appliances at home. We propose a HEMS that can provide
easy-to-access information on home energy consumption in real time,
intelligent planning for controlling appliances, and optimization of power
consumption at home. The HEMS consists of three modules: an advanced power
control planning engine, a device control module, and a power resource
management server. Our prototype system reduces the cost of power
consumption by about 10%.
