Development of computer vision systems raises a problem of creating
effective methods for restoring surface characteristics from their
photographic images minimizing calculations while preserving reasonable
accuracy of measurements. Here optimized algorithms of the surface
reconstruction from stereo-images is proposed. The optimization is achieved
by introducing some constraints on the conditions of image recording and by
involving an a priory affirmation about objects in study. Effective
algorithms have been developed on the basis of correlation method estimating
corresponding points on images in stereo set and disparity map computation.
Performance optimization is achieved by some modifications of correlation
method including a pyramidal presentation of the images. The system uses a
stereoscopic registration of face images and performs real-time image
processing. The system was tested on a database of stereo- images.
