Some inequalities for the Boltzmann collision integral are proved. These
inequalities can be considered as a generalization
of the well-known Povzner inequality. The inequalities are used to obtain
estimates of moments of the solution to the spatially
homogeneous Boltzmann equation for a wide class of intermolecular forces. We
obtain simple necessary and sufficient conditions
(on the potential) for the uniform boundedness of all moments. For
potentials with compact support the following statement
is proved: if all moments of the initial distribution function are bounded
by the corresponding moments of the MaxwellianA exp(−Bv
2), then all moments of the solution are bounded by the corresponding
moments of the other MaxwellianA
1 exp[−B
1(t)v
2] for anyt > 0; moreoverB(t) = const for hard spheres. An estimate for a
collision frequency is also obtained.
