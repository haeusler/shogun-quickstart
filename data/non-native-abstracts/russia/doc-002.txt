Films of polymethyl methacrylate and methyl methacrylate copolymers with
ethylhexyl acrylate doped with HAuCl4 were subjected to UV irradiation
followed by thermal treatment at various temperatures. The films were
studied by absorption
spectroscopy and small-angle X-ray scattering. The photolysis of HAuCl4 was
found to result in the formation of gold nanoparticles, whose size depended
on the structure of the polymeric matrix.
An increase in the free volume of polymers caused the formation of larger
particles.
