UV irradiation of polymeric PMMA films containing HAuCl4 followed by
annealing at 60–80°C forms gold nanoparticles directly within the bulk
material. The kinetics of nanoparticle formation was traced by extinction
spectra of nanocomposite film changes vs annealing time. We propose that UV
irradiation causes HAuCl4 dissociation and thus provides a polymeric matrix
with atomic gold. The presence of an oversaturated solid solution of atomic
gold in the polymeric matrix leads to Au nanoparticle formation during
annealing. This process can be understood as a phase transition of the first
order. In this paper we apply several common kinetic models of the phase
transition for describing Au nanoparticle formation inside the solid polymer
matrix. We compare predictions of these models with the experimental data
and show that these models cannot describe the process. We propose that the
stabilization effect of the matrix on the growing gold nanoparticles is
important. The simplest model introducing some probability for the
transition from growing nanoparticle to the non-growing, stabilized form is
suggested. It is shown that this model satisfactorily describes the
experimentally observed evolution of the extinction spectrum of Au
nanoparticles forming in a polymer matrix.
