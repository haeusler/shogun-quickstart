Accurate experimental data on pressure broadened profiles of (16)O(12)C(32)S
pure rotational lines in a broad range of quantum number J have been
analyzed taking into account the speed dependence of collisional relaxation.
Refined values of collisional self-broadening coefficients are determined
and compared to previously known data. New quantitative information on
departures of observed line shapes from the traditional Voigt profile is
obtained. It is shown that these departures result mainly from the speed
dependence of collisional relaxation. Theoretical calculations of
self-broadening parameters are performed in the framework of the
semiclassical impact Robert-Bonamy formalism where the mean relative
molecular speed as well as the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of relative
speeds is considered. The necessity of allowance for the speed dependence in
line shape models is confirmed and satisfactory results have been obtained
by arbitrarily limiting the integration of the differential cross section to
a finite value of the impact parameter. It is shown for the first time for
the whole rotational spectrum that speed dependent models not only improve
accuracy of modeling the observed line profiles but also give physically
grounded values of collisional relaxation parameters.
