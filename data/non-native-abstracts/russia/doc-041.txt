A biometric access control system based on identification of human face is
presented. The system developed performs remote measurements of the
necessary face features. Two different scenarios of the system behavior are
implemented. The first one assumes the verification of personal data entered
by visitor from console using keyboard or card reader. The system functions
as an automatic checkpoint, that strictly controls access of different
visitors. The other scenario makes it possible to identify visitors without
any person identifier or pass. Only person biometrics are used to identify
the visitor. The recognition system automatically finds necessary
identification information preliminary stored in the database. Two
laboratory models of recognition system were developed. The models are
designed to use different information types and sources. In addition to
stereoscopic images inputted to computer from cameras the models can use
voice data and some person physical characteristics such as person's height,
measured by imaging system.
