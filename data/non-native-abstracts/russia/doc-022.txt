The issue of scientific knowledge openness is urgent worldwide, but for
Russia it is particularly crucial because of the inaccessibility of the most
cited academic journals there. In this paper a solution for this issue is
proposed by means of the gold- oriented method which assumes placing
scientific papers of traditional academic journals in open access and
ensuring their visibility on the Internet. This method is implemented in the
project of open science repository called as CyberLeninka and discussed in
details in the paper. Also plans to evolve CyberLeninka to a CERIF-CRIS and
vision to build the e-infrastructure of Open Science in Russia are provided.
