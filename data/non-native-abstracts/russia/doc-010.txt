Colloidal particle lens array (CPLA) proved to be an efficient near-field
focusing device for laser nanoprocessing of materials. Within CPLA,
spherical particles do not act as independent microlenses. Due to the
coupling of the spherical modes, the field near the clusters of spherical
microparticles cannot be calculated by means of the superposition of Mie
solutions for individual spheres. In the paper, the electromagnetic field
distributions near laser-irradiated clusters of dielectric microspheres with
configurations that match the fragments of the close-packed CPLA are
studied. It is shown that some practically important mode coupling effects
can be understood in terms of an effective immersion medium formed for the
spherical particle by its surrounding.
