For a rigorous assessment of the precise amount of sample loaded, for
quantitation purposes, different sample injection systems were evaluated
with two commercially available units, Waters Quanta 4000 and Beckman P/ACE
2100. In the first system, sample introduction by hydrostatic means (i.e.,
placing the sample vial at some height, usually 10.1 cm, above the other
capillary end) was evaluated. It was found that in this system there is a
constant positive bias, i.e. the amount of sample loaded lies on a curve
parallel and above the theoretically predicted loading curve. However, the
excess of mass loaded was constant along the injection times explored
(covering from 5 to 35 s) and, for a 75 microns capillary, was found to be
of the order of +6 nL (above the expected injected value). Thus it is easy
to correct for this sample bias. In the electrokinetic mode, a very good
correlation between expected and predicted sample loads was obtained for
both units. In the pressure system (by positive pressure from a nitrogen
tank, Beckman unit) a substantial discrepancy was found between experimental
and predicted values (13.5% overload). Since the manufacturer claims a
constant pressure of 0.5 psi, i.e. 3447.5 Pa, it would appear that the
injection pressure is higher than the given value.(
