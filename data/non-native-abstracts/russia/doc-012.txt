An ion source based on a two-stage discharge with electron injection from a
cold emitter is presented. The first stage is the emitter itself, and the
second stage provides acceleration of injected electrons for gas ionization
and formation of ion flow (<20 eV, 5 A dc). The ion accelerating system is
gridless; acceleration is accomplished by an electric field in the discharge
plasma within an axially symmetric, diverging, magnetic field. The hollow
cathode electron emitter utilizes an arc discharge with cathode spots hidden
inside the cathode cavity. Selection of the appropriate emitter material
provides a very low erosion rate and long lifetime.
