Development of test programs and analysis of the results of their execution
is the basic approach to verification of microprocessors at the system
level. There is a variety of methods for the automation of test generation,
starting with the generation of random code and ending with directed
model-based test generation. However, there is no cure-all method. In
practice, combinations of various complementary techniques are used.
Unfortunately, no solution for the integration of various test generation
methods into a unified environment is currently available. To test a
microprocessor, verification engineers are forced to use many different test
generators, which results in a number of difficulties, such as (1) the
necessity to ensure the compatibility of tool configurations (in each tool,
a specific description of the target microprocessor is used, which leads to
duplication of information); (2) the necessity to develop utilities for
integration tools (different tools have different interfaces and use
different data formats). This paper describes a concept of extensible
environment for test program generation for microprocessors. This
environment provides a unified approach for test generation; it supports
widespread test generation techniques, and can be extended by new testing
tools. The proposed concept was partially implemented in MicroTESK
(Microprocessor T Esting and Specification Kit).
