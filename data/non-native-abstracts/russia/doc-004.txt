Recent progress in powerful subpicosecond laser generation technology
has stimulated interest in interaction of ultrashort electromagnetic
pulses with nonlinear media. Being a classical example of a nonlinear
medium and a traditional object of laboratory investigations, the plasma
demonstrates an extreme variety in behavior under the action of the
electromagnetic fields. Characteristic rise and relaxation times of
nonlinear response can be varied by a few orders of magnitude depending
on particle concentration, wavelength, external magnetic field, etc.
Thus, the ultrashort pulse duration should be defined as a particular
notion with respect to the phenomenon in question. In this paper we take
interest in electromagnetic wave-plasma interaction processes faster
than the relaxation of the nonlinear plasma response. In this context,
we treat the interaction as essentially dynamical and the plasma as a
medium with long-term memory properties. The nonsteady state of the
nonlinear coupling and the plasma wake generation are two main features
essential to the basic physical effects and applications.
