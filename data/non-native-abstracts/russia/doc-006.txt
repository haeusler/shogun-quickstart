The molecular ion is the simplest polyatomic and poly-electronic molecular
system, and its spectrum constitutes an important benchmark for which
precise answers can be obtained ab initio from the equations of quantum
mechanics. Significant progress in the computation of the ro-vibrational
spectrum of is discussed. A new, global potential energy surface (PES) based
on ab initio points computed with an average accuracy of 0.01 cm(-1)
relative to the non-relativistic limit has recently been constructed. An
analytical representation of these points is provided, exhibiting a standard
deviation of 0.097 cm(-1). Problems with earlier fits are discussed. The new
PES is used for the computation of transition frequencies. Recently measured
lines at visible wavelengths combined with previously determined infrared
ro-vibrational data show that an accuracy of the order of 0.1 cm(-1) is
achieved by these computations. In order to achieve this degree of accuracy,
relativistic, adiabatic and non-adiabatic effects must be properly accounted
for. The accuracy of these calculations facilitates the reassignment of some
measured lines, further reducing the standard deviation between experiment
and theory.
