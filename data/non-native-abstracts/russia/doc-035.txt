We consider a simple example of a dynamical billiard consisting of a mass
point moving in a circle under the influence of a homogeneous gravitational
field. The point reflects by the mirror elastic law when it encounters the
circular boundary. The problem is integrable between one collision and
another, and also when the particle moves on the bounding circle. This makes
it possible to build the conditions of existence and stability (in a linear
and, at times, in a nonlinear sense, too) of the families of basic periodic
trajectories determining the phase space topology for a fixed energy level.
The numerical implementation of the Poincar√© mapping offers a means of
describing the phase pictures with regular and chaotic regions in more
detail as well as their evolution as the energy changes. In a weak
gravitational field, numerical experiments reveal only periodic trajectories
that are symmetric about the vertical diameter of the circle. An analytic
proof is given that the imposition of a weak gravitational field causes the
disappearance of nonsymmetric two-, three-, four-, and six-link
trajectories. The phenomenon arises from the superposition of two factors:
the gravitation and the perfect symmetry of the circular billiard. We also
consider motion evolution in the special case of the perfectly inelastic
reflection law.
