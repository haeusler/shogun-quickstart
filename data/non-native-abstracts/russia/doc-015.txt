We report a simple all-fiber design of an Er-doped laser system that is
capable of generating widely tunable two-cycle pulses. In particular, 13-fs
pulses at a wavelength of 1.7 Î¼m are produced. The mechanism of pulse
shortening is identical to the higher-order soliton compression and is
supported by modeling based on the slowly evolving wave approximation, which
is well suited for down to single-cycle pulse propagation in nonlinear
dispersion-shifted fibers.
