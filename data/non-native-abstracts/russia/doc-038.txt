Studies of N.N. Bogolubov, S. Chapman and D. Enskog permit to formulate a
regular way for the construction of hydrodynamic equations in the
postgalilean approximation of relativistic theory. The Boltzmann equation
obtained from the BBGKY-hierarchy with regard to the retardation effects
lies at the basis of this construction. The hydrodynamic equations derived
in this way are distinguished from the results, obtained by de Groot et al.,
where the retardation of the interaction is eliminated. In the present work
the construction of the hydrodynamic equations is developed using both
Lagrange and Hamilton variables for particles of arbitrary tensor valency.
