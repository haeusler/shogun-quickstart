Microwave amplification in relativistic backward wave oscillator operating
below its self-excitation threshold is considered. The conditions that allow
to achieve high gain provided with stable operation of the backward wave
amplifier (BWA) were found. Several schemes of use of the relativistic BWA
providing high power microwave amplification were studied. It is shown that
employing a BWA in regenerative amplification regime allows to obtain more
than 40 dB gain with efficiency over 20%.
