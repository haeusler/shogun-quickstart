Consideration was given to the following statement of the problem of
groupcast routing in the wireless multihop network: in the class of
tree-like routes, it is required to determine a minimal-cost route
calculated with account for the transmission method used by the MAC
protocol. If this method takes advantage of the broadcast nature of the
wireless medium, then the number of attempts of transmission made by a route
retransmitter and their cost depend on the retransmitter neighbor nodes on
the route. This peculiarity makes the considered groupcast routing problem
sufficiently distinct from the classical Steiner tree problem. The
sensitivity of the route cost to the transmission methods used was analyzed.
Also a number of the groupcast routing algorithms were proposed which allow
for the structure of the transmission methods and enable one to reduce the
cost of routes.
