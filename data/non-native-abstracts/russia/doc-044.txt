Parallel implementation of the Fluids-in-Cell Method (FlIC) method is
created for 3D cartesian simulation of an astrophysical
object collapse. The main parameters of the parallel implementation are
given of the FlIC method. The equations under solution
are the gas dynamics equations and Poisson equation. Simulation of collapse
with FlIC method is compared to SPH simulation.
As a result, we can state that FlIC method provided fine enough grid gives
better spatial resolution than SPH.
