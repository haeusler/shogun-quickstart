We show that it is possible to produce nearly bandwidth-limited few-cycle
attosecond pulses based on periodic resonance interaction of a
quasi-monochromatic radiation with the bound states of hydrogenlike atoms. A
periodic resonance is provided by a far-off-resonant laser field with
intensity much below the atomic ionization threshold via periodic tunnel
ionization from the excited states and adiabatic Stark splitting of the
excited energy levels. Without external synchronization of the spectral
components, it is possible to produce 135 as pulses at 13.5 nm in
Li²⁺-plasma controlled by radiation of a mode-locked Nd:YAG laser, as well
as 1.25 fs pulses at 122 nm in atomic hydrogen controlled by radiation of a
CO₂ laser.
