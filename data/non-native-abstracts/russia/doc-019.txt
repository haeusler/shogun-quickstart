The stability of the injection of short electron beams and the dynamic
processes that occur during their transport were experimentally studied.
Beams of energy 200-300 keV, current of 1-1500 A, and duration of 0.05-3 ns
with a current rise time of 30-300 ps were formed in a cold-cathode
electrode gap. The distribution of the accelerating electric field was
highly nonuniform. The cases of vacuum and air insulation of the electron
diode were considered. The shortest beams with currents of a few amperes
were generated in the mode of continuous acceleration of electrons in
atmospheric air. For measuring beam currents, special collector probes were
used which ensured a picosecond resolution.
