We suggest a Penning-type discharge as a trigger discharge for fast
development of pulsed electron cyclotron resonance plasma. The Penning-type
discharge glows at a low pressure as needed. Gyrotron radiation (75 GHz, 200
kW, 1 ms) was used for plasma heating. Fully striped helium ions were
demonstrated, average charge of ions in the plasma was â‰ˆ 2. Experiment and
calculations show that high charge states of heavier gases require lower
initial pressure and longer development time. Only moderate charge states
are achievable in this pulsed scheme.
