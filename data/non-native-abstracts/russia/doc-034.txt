A method for measuring electrophoretic mobilities by means of
isotachophoresis (ITP) at a constant voltage as described by H. Carchon and
E. Eggermont (Electrophoresis, 1982, 3, 263-274) is analyzed. An error made
in this work, disregarding the pH shift arising at the initial discontinuity
on the leader-terminator boundary, has been corrected. This method has been
carefully studied and generalized for the presence of constant
electroosmotic flow in a capillary. The limits of its applicability and the
diffusionless ITP theory in general are discussed. A detailed study of the
evolution of initial discontinuity (stationary boundary) showed some
anomalies not reported previously, particularly non-monotonic concentration
profiles in the vicinity of stationary boundaries. Moreover, in some cases,
diffusion effects and the contribution of H+ ions can also strongly
influence the behavior of moving boundaries. Computer modelling (confirmed
by experimental data) showed that these effects could lead to the decay of
the ITP train, despite the fact that the steady state diffusionless ITP
theory predicts its stability.
