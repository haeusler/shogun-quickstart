According to neurobiological experiments, the effect of the appearance of
spontaneous bioelectric discharges in neural networks
of the brain satisfies the statistics of self-organized criticality.
Theoretical investigations indicate that the critical
behavior is an optimal regime for the storage and processing of information
in the brain. Many model works focused on the
approximation of the experimental data and on the investigation of
information characteristics of signals, whereas the problem
of dynamical mechanisms of their avalanche generation remains almost
unstudied. The conditions of the appearance of high-frequency
discharges at the critical dynamical threshold have been analyzed in the
framework of the biophysical model of the neuronal
network. A probabilistic model of the layer-by-layer activation of cells,
which makes it possible to estimate the key relations
between the parameters for avalanche generation of the discharge, has been
proposed.
