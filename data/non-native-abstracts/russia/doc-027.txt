The renormalization-group approach is applied to derive an exact solution to
the self-consistent Vlasov kinetic equations for plasma particles in the
quasineutral approximation. The solutions obtained describe
three-dimensional adiabatic expansion of a plasma bunch with arbitrary
initial velocity distributions of the electrons and ions. The solution found
is illustrated by the examples on ion acceleration in a plasma with hot
electrons and in a plasma with light impurity ions.
