For finite and compact infinite metric spaces, a concept of a (weighted)
τ-design is introduced which depends on a choice of a substitution function.
To estimate the minimum size of a τ-design a system of orthogonal
polynomials is defined using the average measure of metric balls and the
substitution function. A universal lower bound on the size of τ-designs is
obtained with the help of the solution of the known extremum problem for
systems of orthogonal polynomials. The concept of a τ-design and the bound
considered coincide with those in the case of polynomial association schemes
of Delsarte and the Euclidean sphere for the proper choices of the
substitution functions. This bound is also calculated for some other spaces.
