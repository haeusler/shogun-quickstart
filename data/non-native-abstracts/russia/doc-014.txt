In this paper we suggest a new dynamical model of neuron excitability. It
is based on the classical FitzHugh–Nagumo model in which we introduce the
third variable for additional ionic current. By using the method of fast and
slow motions we study the afterdepolarization, spontaneous secondary spiking
and tonic spiking effects. We build regions in the parameter space that
correspond to different dynamical regimes. The obtained results may be
important for different problems of neuroscience, e.g. for the problem of
working memory.Highlights► A dynamical mechanism of delayed
afterdepolarization and secondary spiking is explained. ► Spontaneous
spiking appears through the saddle-node bifurcation of periodic motions. ►
Transition between the ADP and spontaneous spiking occurs through producing
of finite number of secondary spikes.
