We consider equilibrium problems for the logarithmic vector potential
related to the asymptotics of the Hermite–Padé approximants. Solutions of
such problems can be expressed by means of algebraic functions. The goal of
this paper is to describe a procedure for determining the algebraic equation
for this function in the case when the genus of this algebraic function is
equal zero. Using the coefficients of the equation we compute the extremal
cuts of the Riemann surfaces. These cuts are attractive sets for the poles
of the Hermite–Padé approximants. We demonstrate the method by an example of
the equilibrium problem related to a special system that is called the
Angelesco system.
