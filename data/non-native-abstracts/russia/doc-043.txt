In this paper, a new hydrodynamical code for the numerical simulation of the
collision of the gas components of galaxies is described. The code is based
on the Fluids-in-Cells method with the Godunov-type scheme at the Eulerian
stage. Also, the velocity correction is employed at the Lagrangian stage and
energy imbalance is minimized. The performance of the code is shown by the
simulation of the collision of gas components of two similar disk galaxies
in the course of the central collision of the galaxies in the polar
direction. As a result of the numerical simulations within the model, we
succeeded in determining the main scenarios of the collision of galaxies. At
low velocities, both galaxies and their gas components coalesce. At high
velocities, the massive stellar components of galaxies dissipate almost
freely, leaving their gaseous components slowed down and heated by the
collision. If the common gas component of the colliding galaxies cools down
to the virial temperature, a new galaxy is formed from the two. With the
high collision velocity, the gas component has no time to cool and therefore
the gas dissipates in the intergalactic medium.
