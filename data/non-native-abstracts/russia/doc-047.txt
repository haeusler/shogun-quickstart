We consider the using of graph models (graphs, hypergraphs and hypernets)
for some analysis of functioning problems of the modern information
networks. We discuss some examples of application of these models -
investigated by us and other authors. Using of model Hypernet for the
analysis of networks is described on the example of modeling attacks problem
and network monitoring.
