Results of computer simulations of the evolution of disks that
originally consisted of hundreds of gravitating solid bodies in motion
around the sun are reported. It was found that each terrestrial planet
incorporated planetisimals from the feeding zones of all terrestrial
planets. The embryotic masses of the unformed terrestrial planets may
have exceeded 0.1 m_opus. Most planetesimals in the zones of Uranus and
Neptune migrated toward Jupiter, which ejected them into hyperbolic
orbits. The semimajor axis of the orbit of Jupiter may have been
shortened by 0.5 AU and those of the other planets may have been
increased significantly. The embryos of Uranus and Neptune may have
originated near the orbit of Saturn.
