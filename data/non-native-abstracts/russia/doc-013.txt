Influence of shear flows of the dense plasma created under conditions of
the electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) gas breakdown on the plasma
confinement in the axisymmetric mirror trap ("vortex" confinement) was
studied experimentally and theoretically. A limiter with bias potential was
set inside the mirror trap for plasma rotation. The limiter construction and
the optimal value of the potential were chosen according to the results of
the preliminary theoretical analysis. This method of "vortex" confinement
realization in an axisymmetric mirror trap for non-equilibrium heavy-ion
plasmas seems to be promising for creation of ECR multicharged ion sources
with high magnetic fields, more than 1 T.
