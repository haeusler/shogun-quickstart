An iterative gradient descent method is applied to solve an inverse
coefficient heat conduction problem with overdetermined
boundary conditions. Theoretical estimates are derived showing how the
target functional varies with varying the coefficient.
These estimates are used to construct an approximation for a target
functional gradient. In numerical experiments, iteration
convergence rates are compared for different descent parameters.
