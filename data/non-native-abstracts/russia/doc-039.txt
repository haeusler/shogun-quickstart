We have calculated the P matrix for NN states with definite values of the
orbital angular momentum; Â¹Sâ, Â¹Pâ, Â³Pâ, Â³Pâ, Â¹Dâ, and Â³Dâ.
The positions of the P-matrix poles, obtained from a phase-shift analysis
with inelastic channels taken into account, are compared with bag-model
predictions for the masses of six-quark states. We discuss the possibility
of using the energy dependence of the P matrix for determining the radius of
the six-quark bag.
