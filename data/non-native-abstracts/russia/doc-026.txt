Observations of nearly zero toroidal current in the central region of
tokamaks (the "current hole") raises the question of the existence of
toroidal equilibria with very low or reversed current in the core. The
solutions of the Grad-Shafranov equilibrium equation with hollow toroidal
current density profile including negative current density in the plasma
center are investigated. Solutions of the corresponding eigenvalue problem
provide simple examples of such equilibrium configurations. More realistic
equilibria with toroidal current density reversal are computed using a new
equilibrium problem formulation and computational algorithm which do not
assume nested magnetic surfaces.
