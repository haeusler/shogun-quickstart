It is shown that the evolution of water vapor spectra in the 2500-5000
cm(-1) range recorded at 650 K and pressures up to 130 atms after
subtraction of monomer contribution may be interpreted qualitatively well on
the basis of experimental data on water dimer and trimer obtained from cold
molecular beams and in He droplets. The proposed spectroscopic model
considers water vapor as a mixture of nonideal monomers, dimers, and trimers
at chemical equilibrium. The effect of line mixing is taken into account in
the monomer spectrum modeling. Decomposition of the high temperature spectra
allowed determining a dimer equilibrium constant that was compared with the
previously known values. The contribution of water trimer is assessed. The
performed analysis indicates that the number of bound dimers in water vapor
is quite large, even at such a high temperature.
