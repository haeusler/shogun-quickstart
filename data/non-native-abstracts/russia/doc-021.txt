The paper presents an approach to fast approximate estimation of conditions
for space-time structures appearing in the flows. The approach is based on
combination of optimization problem computation with methods of data visual
presentation. The visual presentation methods are applied for analysis of
multidimensional array containing discrete result data. Optimization problem
solution is implemented by parallel computation in a multitask form. For
some cases, the approach allows to obtain for control parameter of
considered problem the sought-for approximate dependence on characteristic
parameters in a quasi-analytical form.
