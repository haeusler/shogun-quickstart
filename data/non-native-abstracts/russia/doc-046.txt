Agent-oriented simulation became popular now for performance evaluation of
distributed systems, in possession of elements
with cognizant behavior in particular. The agent-oriented simulation package
named AGNES (AGent NEtwork Simulator) is presented
as a tool for simulation of sensor networks. The multi-relay selection
technique for one-to-many signal delivering is described
as example of its work.
