Monotone absolutely stable conservative difference schemes intended for
solving quasilinear multidimensional hyperbolic equations are described. For
sufficiently smooth solutions, the schemes are fourth-order accurate in each
spatial direction and can be used in a wide range of local Courant numbers.
The order of accuracy in time varies from the third for the smooth parts of
the solution to the first near discontinuities. This is achieved by choosing
special weighting coefficients that depend locally on the solution. The
choice of optimal weighting coefficients is discussed. The presented schemes
are numerically efficient thanks to the simple two-diagonal (or block
two-diagonal) structure of the matrix to be inverted. The capabilities of
the schemes are demonstrated by computing well-known two-dimensional Riemann
problems for gasdynamic equations with a complex shock wave structure.
