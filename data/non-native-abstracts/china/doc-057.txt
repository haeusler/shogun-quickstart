This letter proposes a model of FAST TCP that captures its dynamics in
asymmetric networks. It is found that, as in symmetric networks FAST TCP can
achieve stability but its throughput degrades as a function of a measure of
the asymmetry that we call asymmetry factor. The theoretical results are
validated by simulations.
