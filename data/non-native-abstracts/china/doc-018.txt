It is well known that the graph invariant, ‘the Merrifield–Simmons index’
is important one in structural chemistry. The connected acyclic graphs with
maximal and minimal Merrifield–Simmons indices are determined by Prodinger
and Tichy [H. Prodinger, R.F. Tichy, Fibonacci numbers of graphs, Fibonacci
Quart. 20 (1982) 16–21]. The sharp upper and lower bounds for the
Merrifield–Simmons indices of unicyclic graphs are characterized by Pedersen
and Vestergaard [A.S. Pedersen, P.D. Vestergaard, The number of independent
sets in unicyclic graphs, Discrete Appl. Math. 152 (2005) 246–256]. The
sharp upper bound for the Merrifield–Simmons index of bicyclic graphs is
obtained by Deng, Chen and Zhang [H. Deng, S. Chen, J. Zhang, The
Merrifield–Simmons index in (n,n+1)-graphs, J. Math. Chem. 43 (1) (2008)
75–91]. The sharp lower bound for the Merrifield–Simmons index of bicyclic
graphs is determined by Jing and Li [W. Jing, S. Li, The number of
independent sets in bicyclic graphs, Ars Combin, 2008 (in press)]. In this
paper, we will consider the tricyclic graph, i.e., a connected graph with
cyclomatic number 3. The tricyclic graph with n vertices having maximum
Merrifield–Simmons index is determined.
