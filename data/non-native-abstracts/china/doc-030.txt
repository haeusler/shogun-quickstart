It is hard to train the influence variables and to forecast the complex
problems due to the time series. Recently the neural network method has been
successfully employed to solve the forecasting problem. In this paper, an
approach that integrate modified BP neural network optimized with particle
swarm optimization algorithm (MBPPSO) is proposed which applied to forecast
postgraduate entrant and employment problem. It introduces particle swarm
optimization algorithm to optimize the initial weights of the BP neural
network, which effectively improve velocity of convergence BP neural
network. Moreover, the adaptive adjust learn strategy is introduced to avoid
acutely shake of train and decrease the bias error. The experiment results
show MBPPSO can achieve reasonable forecast result.
