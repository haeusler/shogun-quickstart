Anonymity is the property of keeping secret the identity of user accessing a
certain resource or service, and it is a main approach to protect userpsilas
privacy. At present, many solutions of anonymity have been proposed, but
they seldom concern how to evaluate the security of an anonymity mechanism.
As userpsilas actions are often dynamic and random in the network, this
paper proposes a novel conceptual anonymity analysis model based on the
fuzzy relation theory in fuzzy mathematics. Theoretic analysis shows that
the proposed model can effectively analyze the security of existing
anonymity systems in respect of the type of mobility, and can help design a
new anonymity protection scheme.
