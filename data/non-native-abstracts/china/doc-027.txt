Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a novel stochastic optimization
algorithm based on the study of migration behaviors of bird flock in the
process of searching food. Inertia weight, as an important parameter in PSO
algorithm, plays a very important role in controlling the exploitation and
exploration ability of algorithm. Recently, much more attention has been
paid to the research of modified PSO based on dynamic inertia weight. This
paper simply introduces the principle of PSO and overviews the research
advances about dynamic inertia weight in existing references.
