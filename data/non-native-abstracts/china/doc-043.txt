Neural network has been widely used in the field of data mining, but the
traditional neural network has some defects, such as convergence in the
local optimal solution, learning a long time, etc. The genetic algorithm is
a global optimization search algorithm, and can effectively overcome these
shortcomings. Therefore, based on the comparative analysis of the standard
BP algorithm and genetic algorithms, the hybrid algorithm G-BP algorithm
that this paper presents not only retains the original merits of the neural
network, but also overcomes these shortcomings. Through specific application
it has been proved that the algorithm is practical in data mining, and is a
good method of data mining.
