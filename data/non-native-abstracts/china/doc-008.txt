The traditional k-means algorithm has sensitivity to the initial start
center. To solve this problem, this paper proposed a new method to find the
initial center and improve the sensitivity to the initial centers of k-means
algorithm. The algorithm first computes the density of the area where the
data object belongs to; then it finds k data objects, which are belong to
high density area, as the initial start centers. Experiments based on the
standard database UCI show that the proposed method can produce a high
purity clustering results and eliminate the sensitivity to the initial
centers to some extent.
