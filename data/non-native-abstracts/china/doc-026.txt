Intrusion detection system (IDS) always focus on low-level attacks and
raise attacks independently, though there may be logical connections between
them. Meanwhile, the number of alerts becomes unmanageable including actual
alerts mixed with false alerts. Therefore, improved techniques are needed.
The general idea in this paper is to introduce collaboration achieved by
taking advantage of various kinds of contextual information and thus enable
IDS to correctly identify successful attacks while simultaneously reducing
the number of false positives. In this paper, a multilevel event correlation
structure is proposed by firstly assigning each alert a value of confidence
using contextual information and then correlates the preprocessed alerts
based on improved temporal causal correlation combining with confidence
value. At the end, a scenario graph and a high-level alert with final
confidence are presented, which indicates the reliability of attacks
launched through specific path. Through the experimental results with DARPA
Data sets 2000 from Lincoln laboratory, it demonstrates the potential of the
proposed techniques.
