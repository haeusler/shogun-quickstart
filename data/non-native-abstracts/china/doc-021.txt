Effective prediction of the software reliability is one of the active pares
of software engineering. This paper proposes a novel approach based on
wavelet transform and neural network (NN). Using this approach, the time
series of software faults can be decomposed into four components
information, and then predict them by NN respectively. The experience
results show that the performance of novel software reliability prediction
approach is satisfactory.
