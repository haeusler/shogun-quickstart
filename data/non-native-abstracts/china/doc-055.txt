In wireless sensor networks, the network state beacon exchange rate is vital
to determine the quality of service (QoS) performance of network state. It
is important to schedule this parameter adaptively due to the dynamic nature
of the networks. In this paper, an adaptive self-control model for wireless
sensor (ASMW) is presented which model the whole wireless networks as a
closed-loop system. The model is independent of the precision of the model
parameters but operates adaptively. The simulation results show that the
ASMW model is able to improve the performance of wireless networks
effectively in adjusting the value of the beacon exchange rate to the
reference value and uncomplicated to be implied in hardware.
