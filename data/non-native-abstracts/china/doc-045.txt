The correlation between topology and search algorithm is less paid attention
to in unstructured P2P network. In this paper, we focus on designing better
search algorithm to adapt to the current network rather than to design the
universal algorithm to adapt to a variety of network. Analyzing the
characteristics that the flooding algorithm showing in different search
stages in different network, we put forward the segment search algorithm.
Through experiments we find that it has good results. In addition, we design
our algorithm to be simple, as a module that can be easily applied to
existing unstructured P2P systems for immediate impact.
