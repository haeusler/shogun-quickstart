Due to various network intrusions, network security has always been a main
concern of the network administrator. However, nowadays traditional security
tools like IDSs, firewalls etc cannot play the roles of effective defense
mechanisms. Instead, they only generate elementary alerts to form alert
flooding and they often have high false alerts rates. Moreover due to their
weak collaboration-awareness, they cannot detect large distributed attacks
such as a DDoS attack. In this paper, we present an efficient and effective
model for collaborative alerts analyzing. Our system enhances the alert
verification using assetsÂ¿ contextual information. By applying alert fusion
and using a precisely defined knowledge base in the correlation phase, it
also provides a method to get general and synthetic alerts from the large
volume of elementary alerts. Moreover, this system is able to reconstruct
the attack scenarios for multi-step attacks. Experiments show the system can
effectively distinguish false positives, detect and predicate large-scale
attacks in their early stage.
