In this paper, we evaluate the performance of New- reno analytically by
explicitly modeling its slow-start, congestion avoidance, fast retransmit,
fast recovery and retransmission timeout mechanisms. Two packet loss models,
bursty and independent, are adopted in our study. The accuracy of our
proposed New-reno model is verified by simulations. The performance of
New-reno is then compared with Sack using the derived analytical models. We
show that New-reno outperforms Sack when the round trip time is short and
the bursty loss event probability is low.
