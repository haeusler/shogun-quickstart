Against the defect that the traditional computer network security management
system processes a mass of data with low efficiency and accuracy, a novel
network security management model based on data mining is proposed in this
paper. It makes use of multi-source data collection strategy to acquisition
and integrate the relevant data of different security products, and takes
advantage of data mining technology for massive data to analyze them
comprehensively and intelligently and response automatically. The
experimental result reveals that the model performs well. It can identify
the real attacks from a large number of security events with a good
performance, so that the alarm information will be refined with low false or
wrong alarms, the accuracy, intelligence and adaptability of network
security management will be enhanced and the requirements of new security
situation will be met.
