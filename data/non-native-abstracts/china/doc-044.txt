The topology of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) can be controlled through
changing the transmission power of each node. We propose an adaptive energy
efficient topology (AEET) algorithm where each node adaptively adjusts its
transmission radius by local decisions about its residual power and optimal
transmission radius. We give detailed AEET and analyses the communication
radius in an ideal linear model and two cases of the adaptive topology
control. The AEET mechanism and the topology control procedure are also
given. AEET guarantees a suitable connected node set through interaction.
The resulting network topology increases WSNs lifetime by adaptively
adjusting transmission power. Through simulating AEET, the result proves
AEET scheme is able to prolong lifetime.
