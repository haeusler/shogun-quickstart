How to improve the efficiency of discovering the frequent item sets is a
major problem in mining association rules. This paper analysised the idea
and performance of the general quantitative association rules algorithm ,and
put forward a quantitative association rules mining algorithm based on
matrix, the new algorithm firstly transformed quantitative database into
Boolean matrix ,then used boolean "and" operation to generate frequent item
sets on matrix vector .It effectively solved the bottleneck of Apriori
algorithm which iteratively produced frequent item sets in the general
quantitative association rules algorithm . The results of experiments and
analysis showed that the new algorithm effectively improved the efficiency
of mining quantitative association rules.
