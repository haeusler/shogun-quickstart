Wireless sensor network which is composed of a large number of low-cost,
low-power, multifunctional sensor nodes deployed in a remote environment to
monitor and analyze the data collected in the physical world in a timely
manner. Based on the feature of nodes with limited energy, people have done
some deep research on the prolongation of the lifetime in the WSN. In this
paper, we focus on reducing energy load among all the nodes and present an
improved algorithm LEACH-D based on LEACH. The algorithm combines the ideas
of adjusting the threshold function about the nodes, a fixed radius of the
clustering and a multi-hop communication mechanism among the cluster heads
to achieve advanced in terms of system lifetime energy load among all the
nodes. Simulation results show that the new strategy of cluster-heads
election can improve the network's lifetime effectively.
