Digital works are considered as research focus in most existing digital
copyright protection schemes. But the customers not the digital works have
active aggressiveness. That is to say the customers are the fundamental
reason of copyright protection problem. So customers should be monitored
moreover. The existing identity authentication could verify the legitimacy
of customers. But it can not distinguish the legitimacy of customer
operations. In this paper, we propose an effective behavior authentication
scheme for customers based on fragile watermark and multiple robust zero
watermark technology. After using a digital work, the scheme can decide
whether the digital work is used beyond the usage authority and determine
the customer who exceeded authority further. It is known that the scheme
could be applied in most situations by validity analysis. The experiment
results also show that the scheme is executed efficiently and correctly.
