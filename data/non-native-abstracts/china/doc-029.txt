Due to the existence of hubs in P2P networks, the network becomes more and
more vulnerable because of great reducing in defending against coordinated
attacks. This paper propose a model based on trust value of nodes against
vulnerability, which not only takes into account the node's connections, but
also gives full consideration about the node's trust value, and the
calculation of trust value is broken down to various types of the resources.
In accordance with the type of pre-transaction resources, selects nodes that
have higher trust and fewer connections to make transaction. Simulation
proves that this model can avoid generating hubs effectively, improve the
ability to defend against coordinated attacks, and also enhance the network
robustness and stability.
