A novel semi-fragile watermark scheme for image authentication is proposed
in this paper. New scheme extracts the image content features from the low
frequency domain to generate watermarks, inserts obtained feature into the
image by modulating the wavelet domain, and the watermark generation and
embedment are disposed in the image. To enhance the robustness and
invisibility, the adaptive quantization is used, and quantization step is
calculated according to the local image characteristics. The integrity
authentication and tamper detection are implemented by comparing the
extracted watermark and the extracted content feature. Experimental result
shows that the proposed scheme is robust to common image processing (such as
JPEG compression, noise-adding, filtering), but malicious changes of the
image will result in alarms of the watermark detection. In addition,
proposed scheme can detect the exact locations-the illegal modified blocks.
