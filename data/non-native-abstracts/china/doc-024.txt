In this paper, we have integrated fuzzy logic in the formal context,
developing fuzzy formal concept analysis to support the automatic generation
of primitive fuzzy ontology that can deal with uncertain information. The
proposed automatic fuzzy ontology generation approach consists of the
following steps: first, fuzzy formal concepts are created through fuzzy
formal context; then, the decision rules from the generated formal concept
are obtained using the implicative relations between two fuzzy concept
lattices; and next, Fuzzy clustering is adopted to promote the fuzzy concept
hierarchy of fuzzy concept lattice; finally, a primitive fuzzy ontology is
constructed according to the concept hierarchy structure. A complete fuzzy
ontology can be generated through the expanding of primitive ontology. Since
the fuzzy concept lattice should be from specific fuzzy formal context, the
proposed automatic generation approach is basis on the concept hierarchy
structure which supporting concept learning, thus, for each different
application, it is suitable to pursue the own fuzzy domain ontology model
automatically.
