The fairness in TCP Reno has been long known as unsatisfactory as it gives
more bandwidth shares to short flows while starves the long flows. In this
paper, a new proposal to improve fairness in TCP Reno is presented. We
describe the bandwidth allocation among TCP Reno flows into a new utility
optimised problem, in which the requirement of fairness among flows is taken
into account in the constrain conditions. This problem is then solved by the
Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition to achieve a new distributed algorithm to
allocate bandwidth among flows with fairness being enhanced. On this basis,
we discuss the implementation of this algorithm in the packet level for real
networks using the technique of differential dropping in routers. Simulation
results show that the new proposal regulates the bandwidth share effectively
and improves the fairness performance of TCP Reno. international journals
and conferences. His current research interests include performance
evaluation of computer communication networks, routing protocols for
wireless sensor networks and wireless ad hoc networks.
