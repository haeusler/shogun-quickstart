FAST TCP is a promising new transfer control protocol developed for
high-speed long-latency networks, whose performance has previously only been
studied for data traffic sent in one direction. In this study, the authors
propose a mathematical model for bi-directional connections using the FAST
TCP protocol, which captures the asymmetric bandwidth dynamics in duplex
dumbbell networks, prevalent in ADSL, satellite and other high-speed
technologies. Using this model, the authors obtain a powerful result that
the queue delays observed by opposite FAST TCP flows only have a time
difference in a dumbbell network. Furthermore, the authors establish the
conditions under which the bi-directional FAST TCP flows achieve stability,
and on this basis the throughput rates of the forward and backward flows at
steady-state are deduced. The authors find that, in the case of bandwidth
asymmetry and one flow in each direction, in equilibrium the throughput of
the bi-directional FAST TCP flows can only achieve the smaller link capacity
of the duplex links, and the link with larger capacity is not fully
occupied. These theoretical findings are corroborated by NS2 simulations.
