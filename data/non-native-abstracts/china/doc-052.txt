In most sensor network applications, the information gathered by sensors
will be meaningless without the location of the sensor nodes. Node
localization has been a topic of active research in recent years. Accurate
self-localization capability is highly desirable in wireless sensor network
(WSN). This paper proposes a genetic simulated annealing algorithm based
localization (GSAAL) algorithm for WSN. The proposed algorithm adopts two
new genetic operators: single-vertex- neighborhood mutation and the
descend-based arithmetic crossover. Four example problems are used to
evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. Simulation results show
that our algorithm can achieve higher accurate position estimation than
semi-definite programming with gradient search localization (SDPL).
