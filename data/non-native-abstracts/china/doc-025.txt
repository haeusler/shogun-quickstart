The evenness of energy consumption is one of design challenges for data
transmission in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) which are affected by the
energy-hole problem. With the circular network model which typically
represents for a cluster in the clustered WSNs, we sliced the circular field
into concentric circular bands of fixed width. A energy-balanced consumption
scheme is then presented by combining the direct transmission protocol and
multi-hop transmission protocol. Different from other existed schemes, our
scheme can give a closed-form solution for the probability of multi-hop
transmission mode and that of direct transmission mode. Numerical results
show our scheme balances the energy consumptions of the sensors in different
bands, while keeping the total energy consumption in a rather low level.
