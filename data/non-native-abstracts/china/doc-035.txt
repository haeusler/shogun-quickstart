P2P networks were new stars of 21 century and they were widely used in
nowadays networks. It was very important to study the frangibility of P2P
networks and know the characteristics when nodes invalidated or suffered
intentionally attacked which would be good used in future. This paper
analyzed the frangibility of Gnutella works, including suffered random
failure, degree attack and betweenness attack. And fully study the
frangibility of P2P networks base on small world architecture (SWAN), the
SWAN was best fault tolerance when suffered randomly attack, but worst fault
tolerance when suffered hostility attack compared with the ER model. And
also the frangibility of P2P networks base on small world architecture was
analyzed theoretically and a closed-form solution for average size of
clusters was given which before the largest size of cluster had appeared.
