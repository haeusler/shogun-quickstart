Links of an end-to-end long lived TCP connection may provide bandwidth with
significant variance. In this work, we model and study the effects of
variable bandwidth on TCP throughput, taking into account various
influencing factors such as random loss of links, buffer size and
characteristics of the variable bandwidth in the bottleneck link. Result
shows that the variance of bandwidth can severely deteriorate TCP
throughput, even making it less than one thirds of the one without bandwidth
variance in many cases and arbitrarily low if situations are bad enough, and
that under the circumstance of variable bandwidth, a buffer size larger than
the traditional recommended bandwidth delay product can greatly improve the
throughput. Under the circumstance of variable bandwidth, our model can
accurately model the TCP throughput, with an average error around 5%, and a
maximum error less than 15%, while traditional formula based TCP throughput
prediction can be significantly inaccurate, even with an error larger than
200%.
