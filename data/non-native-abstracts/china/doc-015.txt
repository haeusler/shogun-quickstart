Recently, there is a strong interest in developing wireless sensor network
(WSN) techniques and important applications for moving vehicles, to enable
WSN communication between roadside and vehicles or between vehicles.
Wireless vehicular sensor networks (VSNs) using all kinds of routing
algorithms of low-energy efficiency has recently received considerable
attention. Clustering algorithm has a significant impact on the operation of
WSN. Effective clustering algorithm leads WSN to operate efficiently.
Hierarchical clustering is a new clustering scheme in WSN. This study
presents a novel vehicular clustering scheme integrating hierarchical
clustering on the basis of classical routing algorithm. Simulation results
show that the new scheme efficiently mitigates the hot spot problem in WSN
and achieves much improvement in network lifetime and load balance compared
to the old algorithm which is Direct, LEACH and DCHS.
