Viruses that attack intelligent mobile phones are emerging as a new front in
the fight against various computer viruses. In order to reveal the spreading
rule of mobile phone virus, thus providing theory basis for preventing
mobile phone virus from wide spreading, we consider the characteristics of
mobile phone communication network, and then focus mainly on the short
message network. Based on this specific network, we proposed an epidemic
model of mobile phone virus based on the efficiency of immunization. In this
epidemic model, we listed three basic statuses of mobile phone nodes, as
well as the transition rules betweens these statuses. Through analyzing the
epidemic model and the simulation experiment, we found that the epidemic
model can forecast the development tendency of the node status. We discussed
the influence of the efficiency of immunization, and then made a conclusion
that mobile phone virus can not be removed completely. According to this
model, we can take some measures to control the spreading of mobile phone
virus.
