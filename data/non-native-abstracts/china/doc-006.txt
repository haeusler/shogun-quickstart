In protein-protein interaction networks, proteins combine into
macromolecular complexes to execute essential functions in the cells, such
as replication, transcription, protein transport. To solve the problem of
detecting protein complexes from protein interaction networks, we used
relevant graph and irrelevant graph to represent the relation of connection
between a node and a core graph. We defined a variable Relevancy to
represent whether a node had a dense or loose connection to a core graph.
Then we proposed the Relevancy Judgment algorithm to detecting protein
complexes from protein interaction networks. Our algorithm decided whether a
node belonged to a protein complex through judging the relevancy between
core graph and nodes out of core graph. Experiment results show that our
algorithm has an excellent performance in both accuracy and hit rate.
