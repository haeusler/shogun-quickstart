Energy saving is one of strategic aspects for telecommunication network. As
an important content of telecommunication network energy saving
technologies, the adaptive constant temperature and humidity control and
energy saving technology for air conditioner in telecommunication equipment
room is a very useful method. Because the cooling capacity of air
conditioning for telecommunication equipment room is designed not only to
meet the demand in hot summer but also consider an additional air
conditioner as standby, the cooling capacity of air conditioners in the non
high temperature season is very rich. Adaptive energy saving technology
saves this part of redundant energy so that the average energy saving rate
can reach about 20%. In this paper the application problems of air
conditioner for telecommunication equipment room are discussed. The theories
and core technology of adaptive energy saving are introduced. The main way
of energy saving, statistics of practical application and the electricity
saving rate obtained are also given.
