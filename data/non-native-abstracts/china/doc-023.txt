This article analyzes the nonlinear phase noise caused by an amplified
spontaneous-emission of erbium-doped optical fiber
amplifier and self-phase modulation (SPM) in a differential phase-shift
keying modulation- balanced direct detection optical
fiber communication system. Using numerical methods, the characteristic
function of the differential nonlinear phase noise
cos(Dj){\cos (\Delta \varphi)} in the received electrical current of signals
and the accurate computation formula of the BER are achieved when SPM is
dominant
comparing to cross phase modulation and four wave mixing. The result is
verified by a simulation of a 40-Gbit/s transmission
system.
