One main TCP congestion control objective is, by dynamically adjusting the
source window size according to the router queue level, to stabilize the
buffer queue length at a given target, thereby achieving predictable
queueing delay, reducing packet loss and maximizing link utilization. One
difficulty therein is the TCP acknowledging actions will experience a time
delay from the router to the source in a TCP system. In this paper, a
time-delay control theory is applied to analyze the mechanism of
packet-dropping at router and the window-updating in TCP source in TCP
congestion control for a TCP/RED dynamic model. We then derive explicit
conditions under which the TCP/RED system is asymptotically stable in terms
of the instantaneous queue. We discuss the convergence of the buffer queue
lengths in the routers. Our results suggest that, if the network parameters
satisfy certain conditions, the TCP/RED system is stable and its queue
length can converge to any target. We illustrate the theoretical results
using ns2 simulations and demonstrate that the network can achieve good
performance and converge to the arbitrary target queues.
