Intrusion detection is an important part of network security protection.
Traditional intrusion detection systems (IDSs) only focus on low-level
attacks and raise alerts independently, though there may be logical
connections between them. At the same time, the amount of alerts becomes
unmanageable including actual alerts mixed with false alerts. Therefore,
improved techniques are needed. The general idea is to introduce
collaboration achieved by taking advantage of vulnerability analysis as
contextual information and thus enable IDSs to correctly identify successful
attacks while simultaneously reducing the number of false positives and
providing a stronger validation attack scenario. In particular, with the
verification pattern with precondition and effect of successful attack and
necessary context (mainly modeled as host and connectivity information), the
architecture that proposes in this paper can reduce the false alert rate and
identify true alerts corresponding to successful attacks to construct attack
scenario. Through the experimental results with DARPA Data Sets 2000 from
Lincoln laboratory and the Treasure Hunt Dataset, it demonstrates the
potential of the proposed techniques.
