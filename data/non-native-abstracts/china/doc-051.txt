With the energy constrained nature of wireless sensors, it is a substantial
design issue to make efficient use of battery power in order to increase
their lifetime. An optimal routing approach is critical to prolong the
lifetime of the network. This paper presents a novel clustering scheme
integrating hierarchical method on the basis of classical routing algorithm.
Simulation results show that the new scheme efficiently mitigates the hot
spot problem in WSN and achieves much improvement in network lifetime and
load balance compared to the old algorithm LEACH, which is the most
promising hierarchical routing algorithm to date.
