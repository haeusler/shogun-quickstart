This paper proposes a strategy of the summary sentence selection for
query-focused multi-document summarization through extracting keywords from
relevant document set. It calculates the query related feature and the topic
related feature for every word in relevant document set, then obtains the
importance of the word by combining the two features. The score of candidate
sentence is computed through the importance of words which they contains,
and the modified MMR technology is used to adjust the score of the candidate
sentence, then the candidate sentence with the highest score is selected as
the summary sentence, till the length of the summary is enough. Experimental
result shows that our method performs very well in DUC 2005 corpus and DUC
2006 corpus.
