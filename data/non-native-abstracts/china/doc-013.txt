With the improvement of the P2P network traffic proportion accounted for the
total flow, P2P networks actually had become an important component of next
generation Internet. In P2P network, the existence of Hubs lead to the
reducing of the ability of anti-coordinated attack in entire system, and it
makes the system become awfully fragile. In this paper, aims to the current
phenomenon of the Hubs in P2P network, further studies were conducted. Based
on the ideas of the hierarchical processing of the predecessors this paper
proposes a modified method based on hierarchical processing, it avoids the
conformation of Hubs through optimizing the network topology, reinforcing
mechanism is also introduced. The simulations results validate that this
method can effectively control the conformation of Hubs, enhance the ability
of anti-coordinated attack of P2P network, so it effectively enhances the
robustness of the network, and play a role in load balance, improve the
utilization of the system.
