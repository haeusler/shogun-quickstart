According to the high-dimensional sparse features of the storage of the
textual document, and defects existing in the clustering methods which have
already studied by now and some other problems, an effective text clustering
approach (short for TGSOM-FS-FKM) based on tree-structured growing
self-organizing maps (TGSOM) and fuzzy k-means (FKM) is proposed. It firstly
makes preprocess of texts, and filter the majority of noisy words by using
unsupervised feature selection method. Then it used TGSOM to execute the
first clustering to get the rough classification of texts, and to get the
initial clustering number and each textpsilas category. And then introduced
LSA theory to improve the precision of clustering and reduce the dimension
of feature vector. After that it used TGSOM to execute the second clustering
to get the moreprecise clustering result, and used supervised feature
selection method to select feature items. Finally, it used FKM to cluster
the result set. In the experiment, it remained the same number of feature
items.Experimental results indicate that TGSOM-FS-FKM clustering excels to
other clustering method such as DSOM-FS-FCM, and the precision is better
than DSOM-FCM, DFKCN and FDMFC clustering.
