At present, the FAQ (frequently-asked question) answering system cannot
understand the user's questions at the concept level, so its efficiency
needs to be improved. In this paper, a model of FAQ answering system based
on concept is proposed. The system model consists of three components, which
are concept-based preprocessing, extraction of question-answer pairs, and
concept-based matching of sentences. On the one hand, the model proposes an
index-based extracting method of question-answering pairs, to combine the
extraction with the index mechanism for improving the speed of extraction.
On the other hand, the model expands the user's question at the concept
level, and proposes a concept based matching method between sentences, to
match the user's question with the question-answering pairs. The concept
based matching method concerns the synonymous meanings between sentences at
the concept level. In addition, the experimental result shows the matching
method is an efficient method.
