This paper proposes an energy efficient clustering formation algorithm for
wireless sensor network, which is called ACE-CILP algorithm according to
considering the energy consumption as an optimization parameter. The
algorithm can divide a sensor network into a few clusters and select a
cluster head base on weight value that leads to more uniform energy
dissipation evenly among all sensor nodes. The simulation results show that
ACE-CILP algorithm achieves its intention of consuming less energy,
equalizing the energy consumption of all the nodes, as well as extending the
network lifetime perfectly.
