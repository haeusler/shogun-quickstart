As a kind of brand-new information acquisition and the processing
technology, the wireless sensor network has great significance in
application and scientific research in many fields. But the node
localization information plays a key role in the application of wireless
sensor network. In view of the present situation that the two-dimensional
plane node localization algorithm is difficult to be practiced in the
three-dimensional space, three-dimensional localization algorithm (TDLA) has
been proposed in this paper. Simulations indicate that TDLA can carry out
localization on sensor node in the three-dimensional space effectively and
turns to be one kind of localization methods which can be applicable.
