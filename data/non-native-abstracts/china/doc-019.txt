Free-riding is a grave threat against the existence and efficient operation
of peer-to-peer networks. This study proposes a rank-based fair incentive
mechanism to restrain free-riding and solve the problem of the tragedy of
the commons. In this mechanism, each user has a rank according to its
utility value and it can just visit the corresponding rating files with its
rank in the system. The utility function in this study takes the absolute
contribution value and the physical performance into account for fairness
and their values are calculated by the analytic hierarchy process. Besides,
a pyramidal rank structure is constructed in this mechanism, and the
computation formula for the node's transfer in each layer is established. In
addition, the four defects in other restrain mechanisms are resolved in this
incentive mechanism. The simulations in three aspects have verified that
this mechanism is effective and practical.
