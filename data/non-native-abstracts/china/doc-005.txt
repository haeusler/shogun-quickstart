Based on the Okumura-Hata propagation model, we analyzed theoretically the
effect of background noise on WCDMA properties, and educed the relation
between background noise and coverage capacity. The simulation about noise
indicates that, when background noise increases by about 1 dB, WCDMA
coverage area is reduced by 12%, and the increase of background noise also
reduces capacity. In a word, an increase of background noise debases WCDMA
properties, and these effects are different if the height of NodeB antennas,
NodeB transmitted signal power or cell coverage radius is varied.
